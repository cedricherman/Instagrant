IN ADDITION, THEY WOULD OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF FABRICATING COMPACT, HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION, MULTI-ELEMENT ARRAYS. UTILIZATION OF SILICON AVALANCHE DETECTORS FOR THIS APPLICATION HAS BEEN INHIBITED IN THE PAST BY SEVERAL TECHNICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO SMALL SIZE, LOW INTERNAL GAIN, AND VERY POOR SENSITIVITY AT THE WAVELENGHTS AT WHICH BGO AND OTHER IMPORTANT SCINTALLATORS EMIT LIGHT. HOWEVER, UNDER A RECENT PROGRAM TOEXAMINE THE FEASIABILITY OF MAKING LARGE AREA LOW NOISE AVALANCHE DIODES FOR USE WITH NAI AS GAMMA DETECTORS, THESES LIMITATIONS HAVE PARTIALLY BEEN OVERCOME.

SCHISTOSOMIASIS REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARASITIC DISEASES IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL AGRARIAN THIRD WORLD. CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF EXPANDED AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS UTILIZING PERENNIAL IRRIGATION SCHEMES AND WATER IMPOUNDMENT HAVE PROMOTED THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE. DEVELOPMENT OF VACCINES HAS BEEN SLOW FOR THIS AND OTHER WELL-KNOWN PROTOZOAN AND HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS. A MOST PROMISING APPROACH HAS BEEN UTILIZATION OF RADIATION-ATTENUATED CERCARIAE OR SHCISTOSOMULA WHICH IS INTENDED TO STIMULATE ANTIBODY PRODUCTION IN THE HOST WITHOUT RESULTING IN A FULL-SCALE INFESTATION OR FURTHER PROPAGATION OF THE PARASITE. RESULTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN DEFINITIVE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ADOPTION OF THIS APPROACH AS A METHOD OF PREVENTION OR CONTROL. IN PREPARING THE IRRADIATED VACCINES, LOW LINEAR ENERGY TRANSFER (LET) RADIATION (X-RAYSAND ELECTRONS) HAVE BEEN USED. WE BELIEVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RELIABILITY OF RESULTS (STERILITY AND INHIBITION OF GROWTH ALONG WITH ADEQUATE HOST ANTIBODY PRODUCTION) CAN BE ACHIEVED BY USE OF HIGH LET RADIATION PROTONS, NEUTRONS, OR HEAVIER CHARGED PARTICLES). THE RELATIVELY HIGH MUTAGENICITY VS. KILL OF HIGH LET RADIATION HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED. SHOULD THIS APPROACH PROVE CORRECT, WE BELIEVE THE PROBABILITY OF PREPARING A LONGER- LIVED VACCINE IS ENHANCED. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER STUDY USING THIS APPROACH. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS HAVEHAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE APPLICATIONS OF RADIATION INGENERAL AND IN THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR A VACCINE. SHOULD THE RESULTS OF PHASE I PROVE POSITIVE, IT WOULD LEAD TO A PHASE II EFFORT DIRECTED TOWARD ACHIEVING ACCEPTANCE AND RELIABLE, REPRODUCIBLE PRODUCTION. THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF IRRADIATED ORGANISM VACCINES IN VETERINARY MEDICINEHAS ALREADY BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONSWITH PRINCIPALS OF A MAJOR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL ORGANIZATION INDICATES THAT THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. THE GREATEST INTEREST WILL BE WITHIN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WORKING WITH BIOLOGICALS. A RELIABLE, SAFE, AND LONGER LIVED VACCINE BASED ON IRRADIATED IMMATURE SCHISTOSOMES WILLBE UTILIZED EXTENSIVELY."}, {"title": "A MAJORITY OF VIRUSES AFFLICTING HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK HAVE RNA GENOMES WHICH ARE BELIEVED TO EXIST IN A DUPLEX A CONFORMATION DURING REPLICATION.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE ASSAY TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY WOULD PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN DETECTING CHEMICALS WHICH MAY CAUSE EITHER BIRTH DEFECTS OR CANCER IN HUMANS. THE CAK LINE IS EXTREMELY USEFUL FOR THISPURPOSE SINCE IT IS NEAR DIPLOID LINE, AND A SELECTIVE SYSTEM CAN BE DEVELOPED IN WHICH ANEUPLOIDY CAN BE DETECTED USING RESISTANCE TO 2,6-DIAMINOPURINE (DAP). THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED TO DETECT ANEUPLOIDY BY COMPARING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CHROMOSOMES IN TREATED AND UNTREATED CELLS.

TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE USE OF NATURAL LIGHTING BY CONVENTIONAL WINDOWS, VARIOUS CONCEPTS (PRIMARILY REFLECTIVE LIGHT SHELVES) HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED WHICH PURPORTEDLY IMPROVE THE DISTRIBUTION AND DEPTH OF PENETRATION OF NATURAL LIGHTING WITHIN BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORIES INDICATES THAT MANY LIGHT SHELF APPLICATIONS RESULT IN LITTLE OR NO IMPROVEMENT IN DAYLIGHT PENETRATION. DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF USING LIGHT SHELVES IN NEW BUILDING DESIGNS, THERE IS A GREAT NEED TO PERFORM COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIGHT SHELVES AND DOCUMENT THE RESULTS FOR DISSEMINATION TO THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

ONE GOAL OF SUCCESSFUL SURGERY, THEN, IS TO PREVENTOR MINIMIZE SCAR TISSUE FORMATION AT THE WOUND SITE. PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THAT HYALURONIC ACID (HA) APPLIED BETWEEN THE TENDON AND ITS SHEATH MIGHT DETER ADHESION FORMATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTING HEALING OFTHE TENDON. USING A PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION OF HYALURONIC ACID TO BE PRODUCED AND CHARACTERIZED AT OUR FACILITY, WE WILL DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON TENDON ADHESION FORMATION IN THE RABBIT TENDON ADHERENCE MODEL SYSTEM. GENERAL CRITERIA WILL ENCOMPASS MICROANGIOGRAPHY, HISTOLOGY, AND BIOMECHANICAL TESTING. EXPERIMENTALLY WE WOULD VARY THE CHAINLENGTH OF THE PREPARATION IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EQUAL HYALURONIC ACID CONCENTRATIONS OF SHORT (LESS THAN 100K), INTERMEDIATE (100-750K), AND LONG CHAIN (GREATER THAN 750K) MOLECULAR WEIGHTS.WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE STUDIES PROPOSED HEREIN (SEE SPECIFICAIMS) CAN DEFINITELY DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF AN HA PREPARATION USED AT THE TIME OF SURGERY TO PREVENT ADHESION FORMATION. IN PARTICULAR, DETERMINATION OF AN EFFECTIVE CHAIN LENGTH IN THE ABOVE PROCESS WOULD ALLOW LESS VISCOUS PREPARATIONS TO BE PRODUCED THUS FACILITATING APPLICATION DURING SURGICAL PROCEDURES.

MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST INDIVIDUAL PLAQUE ANTIGENS WILL BE RADIOLABELED WITH (125)I AND INJECTED INTO NON-HUMAN PRIMATES FOR BLOOD CLEARANCE STUDIES. TO CONTROL FOR DIFFERENCES THAT MAY EXIST IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS, THEY WILL UTILIZE A SECOND (131)I RADIOLABELED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY WHICH IS KNOWN NOT TO BIND TO ANTIGENS IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. BY COMPARING OVER TIME THE RATIO OF THESE TWO ANTIBODIES IN BLOOD, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO DETECT SPECIFIC CLEARANCE OF THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT DETECTS ANTIGENS WITHIN THE ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE. THE EXTENT RATE OF ANTIBODY CLEARANCE SHOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMOUNT OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE IN THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.

FIRST, SURFACE RELIEF STRUCTURES COMPATIBLE BOTH WITH THE STABLE, OCTAHEDRAL GROWTH MORPHOLOGY AND THE (100) FILM ORIENTATION ARE TO BE REPLICATED BY DEPOSITING REFRACTORY METAL FILMS UPON TEXTUREETCHED (100) SILICON SURFACES.

THIS PROJECT WILL ANALYZE EACH AREA OF VIDEODISC PRODUCTION AS WELL AS ALL PARAMETERS OF EFFECTIVE MEDICAL INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES AND CREATE AN INSTRUCTIONALDESIGN WHICH DUPLICATES THOSE PARAMETERS AND A STRUCTURED PRODUCTION FORMAT TO ELIMINATE REDUNDANCIES AND WASTE IN THEPRODUCTION SEQUENCE.
