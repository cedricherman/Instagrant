THE ACCELEROMETERS MEASURE THE VEHICLE MOTIONS AND THE MICROPROCESSOR CONTINUOUSLY COMPUTES THE CORRECTION TO BE APPLIED TO THE WEIGHT SIGNAL. FOR PHASE I OF THE PROJECT WE WILL USE A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE INDUSTRIAL SCALE (0-50 KG. IS A COMMONLY AVAILABLE CAPACITY), OFF-THE-SHELF ACCELEROMETERS, AND AN IBM PC AS THE MICROPROCESSOR.

THE OTHER FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH RECORDERS IS THEIR MEMORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE USUALLY SUBSTANTIAL. THESE MODULES WERE DEISGNED WITH 4K AND 16K MEMORIES, THE END RESULT BEINGLARGE, EXPENSIVE MODULES.

AS A RESULT, MANY OF THE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS THAT COULD BE USED IN TRANSIENT RECORDERS ARE IMPROVING RAPIDLY.

CLINICAL TRIAL OF AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE MAV IN 3 PATIENTS CONFIRMED SUBSTANTIAL HEMODYNAMIC EFFICACY FOR PERIODS UP TO 96 DAYS, BUT SHOWED THE PAD TO BE FAILURE-PRONE. IN LATER LABORATORY STUDIES IT WAS FOUND THAT THE BLOOD PUMP'S CONSTITUENT LAYERS COULD HARBOR CELLULAR DEBRIS, FORMING A NIDUS OF INFECTION. SINCE THEN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PAD HAVE RESULTED IN PROMISE OF A STABLE DEVICE, AND A NEW SINGLE-LAYER IMPROVED DESIGN OF THE PUMPING CHAMBER HAS ALSO BEEN EVOLVED. THE OBJECTIVE OF PHASE I STUDIES IS TO CONFIRM THAT THE REDESIGNED PUMPING CHAMBER IS READY FOR LONG-TERM IN VIVO EVALUATION. THE MAV, IMPLANTED IN 5 CALVES, WILL BE PUMPED ON A 6-HOUR-ON, 6-HOUR-OFF SCHEDULE FOR 6 WEEKS. THIS WILL PROVIDE A TEST OF THE ADEQUACY OF THE AORTIC SUTURE LINE.

THE PRESENT RESEARCH PROVIDES A NOVEL APPROACH TO FABRICATING MONOMODE AND MULTIMODE FIBER OPTIC MULTIPLEXING DEVICES USING HIGH EFFICIENCY HOLOGRAPHIC OPTICAL ELEMENTS (HOE) AND THE NON-IMAGING OPTICS (NIO) PRINCIPLE. THE FORMER ALLOWS THE FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION OF COMMON BULK OPTICS COMPONENTS LIKELENSES, MIRRORS, AND GRATINGS INTO A SINGLE ELEMENT, WHILE THE LATTER PROVIDES THE MOST OPTIMAL MEANS OF BEAM FOCUSING AND COLLIMATION IN COMPARISON WITH CONVENTIONAL IMAGING OPTICS. THE INTRINSIC GEOMETRY OF THE HOE AND NIO COUPLERS FOR BEAM FORMING AND SPECTRAL SEPARATION ALSO ALLOWS EASIER MOUNTING AND ALIGNMENT.

THIS THEOREM GOVERNS AND DESCRIBES THE THINKING PROCESS THAT AN IDEAL HUMAN EXPERT WOULD GO THROUGH AS HE INTERPRETSTHE INFORMATION PATTERNS COMING THOUGH HIS SENSORS. WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT THIS THEROEM PROVIDES THE BEST WAY TO STRUCTURE THE HUMAN EXPERT'S KNOWLEDGE INTO AN ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE BASE SO THAT IT CAN BE \"TAUGHT\" TO A MACHINE. FORTHE SAME SEASON, THIS STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE BEST FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE MACHINE CAN BE TAUGHT TO LEARN FROM ITS EXPERIENCE. THIS FRAMEWORK ALSO PROVIDES THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPING FAST, REAL-TIME ALGORITHMS. WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING, THEREFORE, IS TO DEVELOP AN EXPERT SYSTEM FOR REAL-TIME INTERPRETATION AND RECOGNITION, \"DIAGNOSIS\" IF YOU WILL, OF PATTERSN OF IMFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE PLANT. GIVEN THE INFORMATION, HOWEVER INCOMPLETE, THE SYSTEM WILL RETURN A SET OF POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION, EACH WITH A PROBABILITY. STATED IN OTHER WORDS, IT RETURNS A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OVER THE SPACE OF POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION.

IN RECENT MONTHS,BRONZE PROCESSED MATERIAL WITH PROPERTIES AT LEAST EQUAL, IFNOT SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE OTHER APPROACHES, HAS BEEN REPORTED FROM JAPAN; HOWEVER, THIS WAS IN VERY FINE FILAMENTMATERIAL. AT VERY HIGH FIELDS, THE EFFECTS OF PRESTRESS MAKE SUCH FINE FILAMENTS UNDESIRABLE. IT IS STILL NECESSARY, HOWEVER, TO HAVE HIGH INTERFACIAL AREA BETWEEN NBAND BRONZE TO INCREASE THE DIFFUSION RATES OF JC'S. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN TO USE TUBES OF NB AND TO HAVE THE TUBE PERFORM THE DUAL FUNCTIONS OF CONDUCTOR AND DIFFUSION BARRIER. THIS HAS MEANT EITHER POOR UTILIZATION OF THE NB OR, IF TOO MUCH OF THE NB WERE REACTED, BREAKTHROUGH OF SN AND STABILIZER CONTAMINATION. IN THIS PROPOSAL WE SUGGEST THAT THE TUBES PERFORM THE CONDUCTOR FUNCTION ONLY AND ARE COMPLETELY REACTED. BRONZE IS LOCATEDBOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE TUBES AND THE STABILIZER IS SEPARATED FROMT HE REST OF THE CONDUCTOR BY A SEPARATE TA OFV BARRIER AS IN THE EXTERNAL BRONZE PROCESS. IN THIS WAY A MUCH BETTER UTILIZATION OF THE NB WILL RESULT, GRAIN SIZE OF NB3SN WILL BE KEPT SMALL, AND THE PRESTRESS EFFECTS WILL BE MINIMAL. ADDITIVES SUCH AS TI, AND POSSIBLY, TA WILL BE EPMLOYED THROUGHOUT THIS WORK TO IMPROVE DIFFUSION RATES ANDJC AT HIGH FIELDS.

THE GOALS OF A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT ARE TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND PRODUCT QUALITY. THE ENVIRONMENT MUST AUTOMATE MORE LIFE CYCLE TASKS, AND CONTROL THE DEVELOPING PRODUCT WITH BETTER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT. IT MUST ADDRESS THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE, WITH CHANGES TO THE RELATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF EFFORT (INCREASE ANALYSIS, DECREASE MAINTENANCE). THE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD SUPPORT THE USE OF MODERN METHODS AND TECHNIQUES SUCH AS REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN MODELING/SIMULATION (INCLUDING PROTOTYPING), AND PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR EXISTING STANDARDS: ADA (PROGRAMMING), 2167 (DOCUMENTATION).

IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE DISCUSS: SYSTEM ISSUES IN DATA SIGNALING (WHAT KIND OF SIGNAL FORMAT, WHERE SHOULD OPTICAL TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS BE PLACED, HOW SHOULD OPTICAL MULTIPLEXERS AND DEMULTIPLEXERS BE USED, HOW CAN ERROR DETECTION AND CORRECTION BE USED); CONTROL SIGNALS (HOW SHOULD THE ELECTRONIC SIGNALS THAT ULTIMATELY DRIVE THE CROSSBAR CONTROLLER BE DERIVED, SHOULD THE NETWORK OPERATE IN A CIRCUIT SWITCHED OR PACKET SWITCHED MODE, SHOULD DATA CARRY ROUTING INFORMATION ENCODED AS A HEADER); AND PROTOCOLS (THE PROCEDURES OR ALGORITHMS FOR DATA ROUTING FOR THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF THE CROSSBAR NETWORK).

SILICON DESIGNS HAS DEVELOPED A PROCESS FOR BUILDING MICROMECHANICAL SENSE ELEMENTS ON THE SURFACE OF A SILICON WAFER THAT CONTAINS SENSING CIRCUITRY FABRICATED WITH STANDARD INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC) TECHNOLOGY. THIS ALLOWS THE LARGE QUANTITY PRODUCTION OF ACCELEROMETERS WITH SOPHISTICATED ACCOMPANYING ELECTRONICS AT A LOW COST. EACH TRANSDUCER CHIP IS THEN PACKAGED MUCH LIKE STANDARD ICS. SENSE ELEMENTS CAN BE DESIGNED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF ACCELERATIONS. HIGH RELIABILITY, LOW-COST G-SWITCHES CAN BE BUILT WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT DO NOT RELY ON METAL-TO-METAL CONTACTS. IN ADDITION, EACH SENSOR CAN BE INDIVIDUALLY CALIBRATED AFTER FABRICATION, RESULTING IN HIGH PRODUCTION YIELDS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT ELECTRONIC G-SWITCHES CAN BE MANUFACTURED USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN HIGH VOLUMES FOR LESS THAN $5 EACH, POSSIBLY IN THE $2-3 RANGE, DEPENDING ON THE TEST REQUIREMENTS."}, {"title": "THE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE SIMULATION SYSTEM (NASS)-AN ADVANCED APPROACH TO MODELING DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURES ", "Agency": "Department of Defense", "Branch": "Navy", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "6418", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$49,778.00", "Phase": "Phase I", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1987", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "Simnet", "company address": "456 College Ave, Palo Alto, CA, 94306", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "DR DONALD DUBOIS", "Phone": "(415) 324-4242"}, "Business Contact": {"Phone": "() -"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "MANY ADVANCED DEFENSE SYSTEMS, UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR IN THE PLANNING STAGES, HAVE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTER/COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE TOTAL SYSTEM.
