IN ORDER FOR THESE PATTERNING TECHNIQUES TO BE USEFUL, THE DEFECT DENSITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT MUST BE VERY TIGHTLY CONTROLLED AND EXTREMELY LOW (LESS THAN 0.5 PER SQ.IN). TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, SEVERAL APPROACHES WILL BE INVESTIGATED. THEY ARE: 1. PLASMA ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT OF THICK RESIST MATERIALS. IN THIS STEP RESIST FILMS WILL BE USED IN THE 6,000 TO 8,000 A RANGE, WET DEVELOPED AND THE PLASMA CLEANED TO REMOVE THE REMAINING RESIST MATERIAL. THE SOLVENT CHEMISTRY IS USED TO FORM A PARTIAL RELIEF IMAGE WHICH WILL THEN BE ENHANCED BY PLASMA TREATMENT. 2. VARIATIONS IN ACCELERATING VOLTAGE WILL BE INVESTIGATED TO PRODUCE HIGHER CONTRAST EXPOSURE. THESE PARAMETERS WILL BE FIRST MODELED THROUGH COMPUTER SIMULATION AND THEN PRODUCED IN RESIST AND CHECKED BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY ANALYSIS. 3. PRESENT SOLVENT CHEMISTRIES WILL BE MODIFIED TO BE MORE SELECTIVE TO LOWER MOLECULAR WEIGHT SPECIES, THEREBY PRODUCING HIGHER CONTRAST.

IT IS BECOMING AN IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR BOTH CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE HEART OF THIS INSTRUMENT IS A LARGE ARRAY OF NUCLEAR DETECTORS WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES CONSISTS OF BISMUTH GERMANATE (BGO) SCINTILLATOR CRYSTALS AND PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES. IN PRACTICE, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN BOTH THE REQUIRED SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND DESIRED ENERGY RESOLUTION. A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATEDBUT MOST RESULT IN SERIOUS COMPROMISES IN COMPLEXITY, RESOLUTION OR COST. A NEW IDEA WHICH OFFERS A PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS TO USE GROUPS OF SEVERAL BGO SCINTILLATOR ELEMENTS COUPLED TO LARGE PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES WHICH PROVIDE THE NEEDED TIMING AND ENERGY RESOLUTION INFORMATION.IN ADDITION SEPARATE SOLID STATE PHOTODETECTORS WOULD BE ATTACHED TO EACH OF THE BGO CRYSTALS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE EMITTED LIGHT. BY THIS MEANS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE PHOTOTUBES COMBINES WITH THE COMPACTNESS OF THE SOLID STATE SENSOR TO ACHIEVE A VERY DENSE HIGH PERFORMANCE ARRAY.THE KEY PROBLEM IN IMPLEMENTING THIS CONCEPT IS THE LACK OF A SOLID STATE IDENTIFICATION SENSOR WITH ENOUGH SENSITIVITY TO DETECT THE LIGHT EMITTED BY THE SCINTILLATOR.

THESE PHOTOSENSORS OPERATE WITH SIGNIFICANTINTERNAL SIGNAL GAIN WHICH RESULTS IN A BETTER SIGNAL-TO- NOISE RATIO THAN NONAVALANCHING SENSORS.

THE MORTALITY RATE OF ANAEROBIC INFECTIONS CAN BE VERY HIGH IF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AND PROPER THERAPY INITIATED. PREVIOUS TO THE MID 1970'S, IDENTIFICATION OF THE INFECTING ANAEROBE WAS SUFFICIENT FOR PROPER TREATMENT, HOWEVER WITH THE INCREASED USAGE OF THE NEWER ANTIBIOTICS, THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED PATHOGENIC ANAEROBES. THE ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCES OBSERVED ARE NOT LIMITED TO SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ORGANISMS NOR ARE THEY LIMITED TO PARTICULAR ANTIBIOTICS. THEREFORE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM CLINICAL MATERIAL IS NOW NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE PERFORMED ROUTINELY. THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON LABORATORY STANDARDS (NCCLS) RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR TESTING ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF ANAEROBIC BACTERIA IS EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME AND ALSO HAS GROWTH PROBLEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL STRAINTS OF OXYGEN SENSITIVE ORGANISMS. SIMILARLY, THE COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITIES GIVE INCONSISTENT RESULTS AND ARE INCAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF THE MORE OXYGEN SENSITIVE AND NUTRITIONALLY FASTIDIOUS ORGANISMS. THE RESULTS FROM THESE SYSTEMS TEND TO GIVE LOWER VALUES OR FALSE SUSCEPTIBILITIES FOR CERTAIN ANTIBIOTICS AND ORGANISMS.

THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FROM CANCER, LIVER CANCER HAS AN ETIOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSING POPULATION OF MILLIONS WHO SUFFER FROM HEPATITIS B, CIRRHOSIS, AND OTHER CHRONIC LIVER DISEASES. BASED ON STUDIES IN FARBER'S GRIFFIN'S AND LEVIN'S LABORATORIES A PROTEIN EH-PNA (EPOXIDE HYDROLASE-PRENEOPLASTIC ANTIGEN) HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHICH IS RELEASED FROM ITS MEMBRANOUS ENVIRONMENT SPECIALLY IN PRENEOPLASTIC AND NEOPLASTIC LIVER CELLS OF RODENTS.

THESE OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED USING BOTH ANALYTICAL AND EMPIRICAL TECHNIQUES. THERE ARE CURRENTLY THREE CRITICAL PROBLEM AREAS -- IMPROVEDRESOLUTION, ENHANCED NOISE REJECTION, AND AUTOMATION OF THE MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE. THE ANALYTICAL WORK WILL BEGIN WITH A CRITICAL REVIEW OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT BUILT BY SHE FOR CWRU AND WITH AN ON-SITE STUDY OF THAT SYSEM IN USE. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF SUCH ELEMENTS AS PICKUP COIL RESPONSE AND FALSE SIGNALS FROM NEARBY BODY TISSUE. THE EMPIRICAL WORK WILL UTILIZE AN EARLY MODEL CWRUUNIT TO STUDY SPECIFIC HARDWARE PROBLEMS AND TEST POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. CONSULTATION WITH THE CWRU GROUP WILL BE AN INTEGRAL AND CONTINUING PART OF THE PROGRAM. DETAILED ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROTOTYPE DESIGNED IN PHASE I WILL CONSTITUTE PHASE II.

UP TO THIS TIME, DETAILED STUDIES OF CLEARANCE MECHANISMS AND PARTICULATE ACCUMULATION IN HUMAN SUBJECTS HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE RADIATION ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING TECHNIQUES. THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE OF MAGNETOPNEUMOGRAPHY (MPG) NOW OFFERS A NON-INVASIVE, PURELY PASSIVE MEANS TO CONDUCT SUCH STUDIES. IT ALSO OFFERS THE POTENTIAL FOR ROUTINE SCREENING OF INDIVIDUALS TO MEASURE CLEARANCE TIMES AND HENCE CLASSIFY PEOPLE RELATIVE TO THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LUNG DAMAGE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, MPG MAY BE USED TO MONITOR DUST ACCUMULATION FOR PEOPLE IN ENVIRONMENTS KNOWN TO BE HAZARDOUS OVER TIME; WHEN CRITICAL LEVELS OF PARTICULATE ACCUMULATIONS HAVE BEEN REACHED, THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE REMOVED AS REQUIRED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT IN QUESTION. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE MONITORING OF COAL DUST ACCUMULATION IN COAL MINERS. THE FIRST GENERATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETOMETERS CONSTRUCTED BY S.H.E.

COTTONSEED MEAL IS THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF NATURAL PROTEIN CONCENTRATE FOR LIVESTOCK IN THE UNITED STATES. ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE COTTONSEED OIL PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES IS CONSUMED AS SALAD OR COOKING OIL WITH LESSER AMOUNTS USED IN BAKING FATS AND MARGARINE OILS.

GOSSYPOL IS A HIGHLY REACTIVE PHENOLIC MOLECULE WHICH CAN COMPLEX WITH VARIOUS PROTEINS, AMINO ACIDS, ENZYMES AND MINERALS. ITS REPORTED BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ANTIVIRAL, ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTITUMOR, ANTIOXIDANT, PESTICIDAL, TUMOR PROMOTOR, INTERFERON, AND ANTIFERTILITY EFFECTS. WHEN INGESTED IN EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS IN ITS FREE STATE, IT CAUSES ADVERSE EFFECTS ON DAIRY COW PRODUCTION. IT IS TOXIC TO NON-RUMINANT ANIMALS.

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY BY WHICH THE GENES CODING FOR DISEASE-SPECIFIC ANTIGENS CAN BE RAPIDLY CLONED USING RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNIQUES. THE SYSTEM LENDS ITSELF TO HIGH LEVEL EXPRESSION OF THESE ANTIGENS AS HYBRID PROTEINS, WHICH FACILITATES PRODUCTION OF ANTIBODIES TO THE ANTIGENS. WITH BOTH ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODY, IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC TESTS CAN BE PRODUCED FOR DETECTION OF THESE ANTIGENS IN CLINICAL SAMPLES. THIS SYSTEM, ENCOMPASSING RECOMBINANT DNA AND IMMUNODIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES, CAN POTENTIALLY DISCOVER LARGE NUMBERS OF DISEASE SPECIFIC ANTIGENS. A SPECTRUM OF ANTIGENS, SPECIFIC FOR ONE DISEASE, AND TESTS FOR THEM, COULD HAVE CONSIDERABLE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC VALUE. B. IN PHASE I A CDNA LIBRARY WILL BE CONSTRUCTED FROM AN ESTABLISHED HUMAN LEUKEMIA CELL LINE SUCH AS ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (ALL).

CLONES CARRYING LEUKEMIA SPECIFIC DNA CAN BE INDUCED, WHICH, WITH THE LAMBDAGTLL SYSTEM, WILL LEAD TO EXPRESSION OF SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF THE ANTIGEN FUSED TO B-GALACTOSIDASE (HYBRID PROTEINS). BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE SIZE, THE PROTEINS CAN BE EASILY PURIFIED AND USED TO RAISE SPECIFIC ANTISERA. C.

THE USE OF RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNIQUES GIVES THIS METHODOLOGY THE POWER TO FIND SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF, AS YET, UNIDENTIFIED LEUKEMIA ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS. THIS COULD LEAD TO DISCOVERY OF ANTIGENS USEFUL IN EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A SPECIFIC LEUKEMIA, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL OF DISCOVERING AN ANTIGEN(S) SPECIFIC FOR MORE THAN ONE LEUKEMIA.

THIS INVESTIGATION WILL FOCUS ON ULTRASONIC EFFECTS ON FINE PARTICLE SEPARATION OF COAL FROM ASH, PYRITE AND LIKE MINERAL MATTER AFTER GRINDING. COAL ORGANIC MATTER, INCLUDING SULFUR CONTAINING ORGANICS, HAS A SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF LESS THAN ABOUT 1.6. CLAYS AND MINERALS FROM OVERBURDEN HAVE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES BETWEEN 2.4 - 2.8, WHILE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF PYRITE IS ABOUT 5.0. HENCE, CONVENTIONAL COAL CLEANING PLANTS USE SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO EFFECT REMOVAL OF CLAYS AND PYRITE. MANY COALS CONTAIN PYRITE AND MINERALS WHICH ARE OF SMALL PARTICLE SIZE AND WIDELY DISPERSED. SPECIFIC GRAVITY WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING WIDELY DISPERSED PYRITE. THE CYCLIC VIBRATORY MOTION OF A PNEUMATIC MEDIUM INFLUENCES SUSPENDED DISCRETE PARTICLES TO A VARYING EXTENT. AT ONE EXTREME, WHEN THE PARTICLES ARE VERY SMALL AND/OR THE FREQUENCY IS LOW, THE PARTICLES VIBRATE IN PHASE WITH THE MEDIUM AND AT THE SAME AMPLITUDE. AT THE OTHER EXTREME, WHEN THE PARTICLES ARE VERY LARGE AND/OR THE FREQUENCY IS HIGH THE PARTICLES REMAIN STATIONARY. AS THE FREQUENCY IS INCREASED, THE LARGEST PARTICLES ARE THE FIRST TO LAG BEHIND THE VIBRATION OF THE MEDIUM AND, FINALLY, TO STOP VIBRATING. INCREASE OF FREQUENCY FURTHER LIMITS THE SIZE OF PARTICLES RESPONDING, THE SQUARE OF THE LIMITING PARTICLE DIAMETER BEING INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY. IN THIS PROJECT, ULTRASONIC EFFECTS ON ENTRAINMENT AND SEDIMENTATION AS A FUNCTION OF PARTICLE SIZE, DENSITY AND SHAPE WILL BE ANALYZED.

THE HIGH MORTALITY RATE OF NEAR 60% MAKES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR THIS CANCER OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE SINCE EARLY DETECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH CURE RATES.

MICROCARRIER SYSTEMS SHOW GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE LARGE SCALE GROWTH OF CELLS AND THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR METABOLIC PRODUCTS. THE AIM OF PHASE I IS TO PRODUCE MICROCARRIERS OF NEAR IDEAL SIZE AND DENSITY FROM SEVERAL INORGANIC MATERIALS AND THEN TO EVALUATE THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF HUMAN DIPLOID FIBROBLASTS IN SMALL SCALE STATIONARY AND SUSPENSION CULTURES. INORGANIC MATERIALS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE COST EFFECTIVE IN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPECTED DURABILITY AND THUS THEIR POTENTIAL FOR REUSE. CURRENT POLYMER BASED MICROCARRIERS HAVE LITTLE POTENTIAL FOR OR ARE INTRINSICALLYNOT REUSABLE. THE MATERIAL SELECTED FOR THIS STUDY (SI, SIO(2) ONE TYPE OF GLASS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN A CONVENTIONAL MONOLAYER CULTURE. IN ADDITION A LARGE AMOUNT OF RECENT DATA FROM THE FIELD OF CELL BIOLOGY SHOWS THE TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE THE SUBSTRATE HAS ON THE BIOLOGICALBEHAVIOR OF CELLS. THUS THE INORGANIC MATERIALS CHOSEN MAY ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR SUPPORTING IMPROVED CELL GROWTH AND/OR MORE FAVORABLE METABOLIC ACTIVITY. PRELIMINARY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT A VARIETY OF CELLS GROWN ON ONE TYPEOF GLASS MICROCARRIER WERE INDEED BIOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM CELLS GROWN ON DEXTRAN BASED MICROCARRIERS. THE MICROCARRIERS WILL BE PRODUCED BY PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION SPECIFICALLY SPUTTERING. USING THIS TECHNIQUE THE OXYGEN CONTENT CAN BE CONTROLLED FROM SI (NO OXYGEN) TO SIO(2); THUS ALTERING THE SURFACE CHARGE STATE OF THE MICROCARRIER. THE SIMPLICITY AND ECONOMY OF THE FABRICATION PROCESSES WILLALSO BE CONSIDERED. THE MICROCARRIERS WILL BE 100-150 M IN DIAMETER WITH THE DENSITY OF .04 G/CC. THESE PARAMETERS MAXIMIZE THE SURFACE AREA WHILE STILL SUPPORTING CELL GROWTHAND ARE NEARLY NEUTRALLY BOUYANT IN OUR CULTURE MEDIA. HOWEVER, BOTH THE SIZE AND DENSITY CAN READILY BE VARIED IN THE APPLICANT'S MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

THE COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY OF EASILY VISUALIZED, NONFLUORESCENT MONOCLONAL REAGENTS WILL PERMIT CLINICAL HOSPITAL LABORATORIES TO PERFORM CELL MARKER STUDIES ON ALREADY EXISTENT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS, WHICH PERFORM ROUTINE BLOOD CELL DIFFERENTIALS IN MANY LABS.

A FEW METHODS OF TRANSFERRING ARTWORK TO VIDEODISC HAVE BEEN TRIED. SELECTION OF A TRANSFER METHOD HAS GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY PRODUCERS BASED UPON THE EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TO THEM. MEDIA DESIGN ASSOCIATES (MDA) HAS EXPERIENCE IN FILM AS WELL AS VIDEO PRODUCTION. THUS, MDA IS PROPOSING A SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF SIX METHODOLOGIES (SOME FILM BASED AND SOME VIDEO BASED) FOR TRANSFERRING ARTWORK TO VIDEODISC. THE COST EFFECTIVENESS AND QUALITY OF IMAGES WILL BE THE MAJOR CRITERIA FOR JUDGING THE METHODOLOGIES. THE METHODOLOGIES THAT MAXIMIZES THESE TWO VARIABLES WILL BE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT WORK SUGGESTED FOR PHASE II. THE ENTIRE PROJECT WILL ORGANIZE THE VISUAL LIBRARY, DO A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF TRANSFER METHODOLOGIES, TRANSFER THE ART LIBRARY TO VIDEODISC, DEVELOP ARCHIVAL RETRIEVAL SOFTWARE PACKAGES, AND PRODUCE SOFTWARE PACKAGES FOR NEW EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS WITH THE VISUAL LIBRARY."}, {"title": "BACK PAIN RANKS SECOND ONLY TO THE COMMON COLD AS A CAUSE OF TIME LOST FROM WORK (1).

SUCH APNEAS ARE THOUGHT TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME. ALTHOUGH A VARIETY OF MONITORS ARE AVAILABLE TO DETECT CENTRAL APNEAS, NONE ARE SUFFICIENTLY SIMPLE TO USE OR RELIABLE ENOUGH TO DETECT OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS. RESPIRATORY MUSCLE EFFORTS DURING OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS ARE BEST DETECTED BY CHANGES OF INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE, BUT HERETOFOR THIS REQUIRED INSERTION OF AN ESOPHAGEAL BALLOON CATHETER WHICH IS TOO INVASIVE FOR LONG TERM MONITORING. INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE SWINGS IN THE ABSENCE OF AIRFLOW AT THE NOSE AND MOUTH ESTABLISH THE DIAGNOSIS OF OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS. EXTERNAL MONITORING DEVICES PLACED AROUND THE RIB CAGE OR ABDOMEN ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE FOR DETECTING CENTRAL APNEAS BUT MIGHT FALSELY RECORD NORMAL BREATHING DURING OBSTRUCTIVE APNEA. THE PROPOSAL FOR PHASE I IS TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A GOAL. FOR PHASE 2, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FIELD TRIALS WILL FURTHER REFINE THE METHODOLOGY. THE TECHNIQUES ARE BASED UPON TRANSDUCER KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPED BY RESPITRACE CORPORATION ALONG WITH AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF CRANIAL BONE MOVEMENTS TO THE RESPIRATORY CYCLE.

THESE ADDITIONS AND CHANGES WILL INCLUDE: TRANSMISSION OF THE IMAGE TO A VISION MODULE FOR RE-ORIENTATION; TRANSIENT STORAGE OF THE IMAGE (E.G. A FULL PAGE); VIEWING EACH CHARACTER FROM THE FOUR CARDINAL DIRECTIONS; ACCESS TO BLOB CONNECTION POINTS. EACH CHARACTER IS LOOKED UPON AS A CONNECTED OBJECT WHICH IS CONSTRUCTED FROM A SERIES OF BLOBS. THIS UPGRADED CONNECTIVITY BOARD CAN ITSELF GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS THE UNIQUE DETERMINATION OF EACH VIEWED CHARACTER BY EXTRACTING TWO NEW FEATURES, THE NUMBER OF LAKES IN THE CHARACTER AND THE DIRECTIONS OF ITS BAYS AND BY COMPARING THEM TO THOSE CATALOGUED IN A LOOK UP TABLE. THERE ARE A FEW SETS OF CHARACTERS THAT HAVE IDENTICAL BAY AND HOLE FEATURES (E.G. C,F,G). IN SUCH CASES, THE MACHINE VISION MODULE USED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS CONNECTION CONCEPT, MEASURES EACH CHARACTER'S FEATURES (CENTROID, AREA, PERIMETER) AGAIN IN REAL TIME, TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTER UNIQUELY.

INTRODUCTION - ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT OF LYMPOCYTIC MALIGNANCIES IS THE USE OF MONOCLONAL ANTI--IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST THE SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULIN OF MALIGNANT B LYMPHOCYTES. SUCH REAGENTS COMBINE WITH MALIGNANT LYMPHOCYTES BUT NOT WITH NORMAL CELLS. THE MOST CONCRETE SUCCESS WITH THIS APPROACH WAS REPORTED BY A GROUP UNDER DR. RON LEVY AT STANFORD. IN A PATIENT EFFLICTED WITH DIFFUSE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED LYMPHOCYTIC LYMPHOMA, MONOCLONAL ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODY INDUCED A COMPLETE REMISSION WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. ALTHOUGH NO FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, THE APPROACH SEEMS SO PROMISING THAT BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER HAS INITIATED RESEARCH INTO THE PRODUCTION OF ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING THESE ANTIBODIES CONSISTS OF MANY STEPS, BUT ONE OF THESE, THE SOMATIC CELL HYBRIDIZATION OF MALIGNANT B LYMPHOCYTES FOR ISOLATION OF MALIGNANT CELL SURFACE IMMUNOGLOBULIN, PRESENTS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF LYMPHOCYTE CELLS AVAILABLE FROM ALL BUT EXTREMELY ILL PATIENTS. RECENTLY A NEW FUSION TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN EXPLORED WHICH USES ELECTRONIC RATHER THAN CHEMICAL FORCES TO INDUCE FUSION. THIS ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE OFFERS MANY ATTRACTIVE FEATURES BUT THE MOST CRITICAL IS ITS ABILITY TO FUSE VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS WITH EXTREMELY HIGH FUSION FREQUENCY.

THE TWO STATES OF THE DUAL STATE OPTIC ARE GENERATED BY APPLYING CONTROLLED PATTERNS OF SMALL AMPLITUDE, HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS TO ONE OF THE COMPONENTS IN THE OPTICAL SYSTEM, SUCH AS THE SECONDARY MIRROR.
