LASERS OF VARIOUS WAVELENGTHS ARE SUITED FOR DIFFERENT SPECIFIC SURGICAL FUNCTIONS. CO2 (10.6 ) RADIATION HAS SMALL PENETRATION DEPTHS IN TISSUES. THIS LEADS TO HIGH SURFACE TEMPERATURES WHICH ARE DESIRABLE FOR TISSUE INCISION THROUGH EVAPORATION. ND:YAG LASERS (1.06 ) PROVIDE VOLUMETRIC TISSUE HEATING WHICH IS EFFECTIVE IN VASCULAR COAGULATION. IN THE TREATMENT OF TUMORS AND CANCEROUS TISSUES, CONCURRENT HEMOSTASIS AND INCISION ARE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS FOR WIDESPREAD CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF LASERS AS SURGICAL TOOLS. THE SPECIFIC AIM OF THIS PROPOSED EFFORT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW SURGICAL LASER SYSTEM CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THESE SIMULTANEOUS FUNCTIONS. THE SYSTEM HAS THE ADVANTAGES OF A SINGLE POWER SUPPLY AND ONE LASER HEAD. IT CAN PROVIDE THE ADDED FUNCTION OF CUTTING, WHICH ND-YAG ALONE CANNOT SUITABLY PERFORM. IT SHOULD ACCOMPLISH HEMOSTASIS OF VASCULAR REGIONS WHERE CO2 IS NOT ADEQUATE. IN ADDITION, AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IS ITS COMPATIBILITY WITH CONVENTIONAL QUARTZ FIBER OPTICS DELIVERY SYSTEM. SUCH A LASER WILL HAVE WIDESPREAD CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL. THIS RESEARCH EFFORT NATURALLY FALLS WITHIN THE REALM OF PROGRAM ACTIVITIES SPONSORED BY THE DIVISION OF CANCER TREATMENT, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PHASE I PROGRAM ARE TWO FOLD. (1) A COMPLETE DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF THE LASER SYSTEM CAPABLE OF DELIVERING THE NECESSARY POWERS AT 1.06 AND 1.9 WILL BE PERFORMED. (2) EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE TISSUE ABSORPTION AND INTERACTION CHARACTERISTICS AT 1.9 , THUS VERIFYING THE POWER LEVELS NECESSARY FOR INCISION.

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTES, WHICH NEED TO BE ISOLATED FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS. UNDERGROUND DISPOSAL IS AN OPTION THAT SHOW CONSIDERABLE PROMISE IF ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE TO ITS LONG-TERM SAFETY. A MAJOR CRITERION IN IDENTIFYING A SUITABLE SITE IS FOR THERE TO BE LITTLE WATER CIRCULATION TO PREVENT WIDESPREAD AND RAPID DISPERSAL IF THE STORAGE CONTAINERS ARE BREACHED. LOW CIRCULATION MAY BE ASSURED IF THE GROUNDWATER IS VERY OLD. THERE ARE MANY METHODS OF ESTIMATING GROUNDWATER AGES, BUT ATMOSPHERIC RADIONUCLIDES ARE, PERHAPS, THE MOST DIRECT AN MOST ACCURATE. TANDEM ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY HAS RECENTLY MADE 36C1 (3.1X105 YR.) AVAILABLE AS A WATER DATINGTECHNIQUE. ANOTHER RADIONUCLIDE, 81KR (2.1X105 YR.), SHOWS GREAT PROMISE AS A WATER DATING METHOD AND HYDROLOGICAL TRACER. 81KR WILL COMPLEMENT INFORMATION GAINED FROM 36C1 AND OTHER DATING TECHNIQUES, AND BECAUSE OF THE CHEMICAL INERTNESS OF KRYPTON, MAY SIMPLIFY INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. 81KR CANNOT BE MEASURED WITH TAMS. RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (RIS) INVOLVES THE STEPWISE EXCITATION, IONIZATION, AND COUNTING OF ATOMS OF A PRE-SELECTED ELEMENT. BECAUSE NARROW-BAND LASERS ARE USED, SUFFICIENT OPTICAL POWER ENABLES ALL OF THE ATOMS OF THE SELECTED ELEMENT TO BE IONIZED, WHILE THE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER ELEMENTS REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE. THE IONS FORMED ARE EXTRACTED AND PASSED THROUGH A MASS SPECTROMETER, THEREBY ACHIEVING ISOTOPIC SELECTIVITY. BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH ISOTOPE RATIOS IN 81KR COUNTING, SEVERAL ENRICHMENT STEPS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE COUNTING BY RIS. IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM TO DEVELOP 81KR COUNTING TO ENABLE ROUTINE MEASUREMENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL TRACER. PHASE I WILL CHARACTERIZE EXISTING ENRICHMENT PROCEDURES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICAL ENRICHMENT SYSTEMS. AS A TEST, THE 81KR CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERIC KRYPTON WILL BE MEASURED.

THE MICROCAPSULES RELEASE THE DRUG IN ZERO ORDER AND MAINTAIN A THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE LIQUID BASE. RELEASE IS CONTROLLED BY MICROCAPSULE SIZE AND THICKNESS OF THE CAPSULE WALL.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE SYSTEM IS A MACROPOROUS MEMBRANE WHICH DELIVERS A THIN LIQUID FILM OF THE VEHICLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN TO OCCLUDE THE SKIN. THE FILM FORCES HYDRATION OF THE STRATUM CORNEUM WITH WATER FROM THE LOWER LAYERS OF THE EPIDERMIS AND ACCELERATES THE DELIVERY OF THE STEROIDS. BECAUSE OF THE INTIMATE CONTACT BETWEEN THE SKIN SURFACE AND THE THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE VISCOUS LIQUID BASE UNIFORM DELIVERY OF THE DRUG IS INSURED THROUGHOUT THE TREATMENT PERIOD.

THE PAPER DISCUSSED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE POHC CONCEPT AS A MEANS TO VALIDATE INCINERATOR PERFORMANCE AND SUGGESTED AN ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY INVOLVING THE USE OF PERFLUORINATEDCOMPOUNDS AS MARKERS FOR DRE. SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH MAKE THESE COMPOUNDS SUITABLE CANDIDATES WERE EXAMINED WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT SULFUR HEXAFLUORIDE (SF6) WAS RECOMMENDED ASSUITABLE SURROGATE FOR INDICATING THE DRE OF INCINERATORS FOR POHC COMPOUNDS. THE MAJOR DRAWBACK TO EPA ACCEPTING THE METHODOLOGY AS A TOOL IS THE LACK OF DATA CORRELATING THE POHC DRE'S WITH THOSE OF SF6. TRACER TECHNOLOGIES PROPOSES APHASE I PROGRAM TO CORRELATE SEVERAL POHC DRE'S WITH SF6 DREUNDER A VARIETY OF LABORATORY CONDITIONS.

PFEFFERLE ASSOCIATES (WCP) HAS INVENTED A PROPRIETARY CATALYTICALLY-ENHANCED MODIFICATION OF A DIESEL ENGINE WHICH OFFERS A NUMBER OF PROMISING FEATURES, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANTLY-REDUCED COMBUSTION NOISE LEVELS. USING CATALYSTS PLACED PERMANENTLY IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER OF A DIESEL ENGINE, WCP HAS DEMONSTRATED RAPID CONSTANT-VOLUME COMBUSTION OF DIESEL FUEL ACCOMPANIED BY A NOTICEABLY-LOWER NOISE LEVEL (CONFIRMED BY A PRESSURETRACE WITHOUT HIGH FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS) AND A COMBUSTION CHAMBER FREE OF VISIBLE SOOT. WE BELIEVE THIS SYSTEM CAN INEXPENSIVELY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NOISE EMISSIONS IN FIELD DIESEL GENERATORS (AS WELL AS OTHER MILITARY DIESELS) WHILE IMPROVING FUEL ECONOMY AND POWER AND ALSO OFFERING OTHER IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS RFP.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROVIDE THEORETICAL DESIGN TOOLS AND INTERCONNECTION STRATEGIES CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING REAL-TIME IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS VIA LIMITED USER-PROGRAMMABLE MECHANISMS (E.G., FIRMWARE). FLEXIBLE FIRMWARE-ORIENTED ARCHITEC TURES DEDICATED TO SIGNAL PROCESSING CAN THEN BE IDENTIFIED. A SYSTOLIC ARRAY FOR PERFORMING RECURSIVE LEAST-SQUARES MINIMIZATION IS PROPOSED.

THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMERCIAL PACKAGES MAKES CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERT SYSTEM SHELLS DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY FOR MOST APPLICATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF 1) MOVING REAL-TIME DATA TO/FROM MULTIPLE EXPERT SYSTEMS AND 2) GIVING THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMER FREEDOM TO EXPERIMENT EASILY WITH MESSAGE PRIORITIES AND TASK PRIORITIES/ALLOCATION. THE KEY TO THIS PROPOSED CONCEPT IS DESIGN OF A SET OF SOFTWARE TOOLS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE APPLICATION PROGRAMMER IN A MULTITUDE OF ENVIRONMENTS. THIS ALLOWS HIM TO DESIGN PRIORITIZED MESSAGES BETWEEN EXPERT SYSTEM AND REAL-TIME PROCESSES WITHOUT CONCERN FOR THE DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION. THIS ALSO FREES HIM TO CHOOSE THE BEST SHELL, PACKAGE OR CUSTOM SOFTWARE FOR EACH PIECE OF A PROBLEM."}, {"title": "PACKET COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS SYSTEM (PHASE I: STUDY OF ROUTING ALGORITHMS) ", "Agency": "Department of Defense", "Branch": "Air Force", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "2232", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$360,000.00", "Phase": "Phase II", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1986", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "Star Corp.", "company address": "Po Box 3385, Lawrence, KS, 66044", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "Dr K Sam Shanmugan", "Phone": "(913) 841-1283"}, "Business Contact": {"Phone": "() -"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS ARE EVOLVING FROM PREDOMINANT CIRCUIT SWITCHED TECHNOLOGY TO PACKET SWITCHED SYSTEMS.
