STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT INFLAMED SULCI ARE ACCOMPANIED BY ELEVATED TEMPERATURE INDICATIONS. CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS BLEEDING UPON PROBING, SUPPURATION, OR GINGIVAL REDNESS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE DIAGNOSTICS WITH RESPECT TO THE DETECTION OF ACTIVE DISEASES. THE TEMPERATURE SENSING ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED PROBE IS IMBEDDED IN THE PROBE TIP. THE TIP SHAPE AND SIZE ARE SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL PERIODONTAL PROBES WITH WILLIAMS MARKINGS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A PROBE ARE (1) THE CONCURRENT MEASUREMENT OF SUCULAR TEMPERATURE AND ATTACHMENT LEVEL, (2) THE IDENTICAL PROBE INSERTION TECHNIQUE USED IN CONVENTIONAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL MEASUREMENT, AND (3) THE RAPIDITY IN ALLOWING FOR MULTIPLE-SITE EVALUATION OF DISEASE ACTIVITY. THE KEY FEATURE OF THIS PROBE WHICH ALLOWS THE FAITHFUL MEASUREMENT OF SULCULAR TEMPERATURE IS THE SPECIALLY DESIGNED LOW THERMAL MASS OF THE PROBE TIP. THIS FEATURE PROVIDES MINIMAL THERMAL PERTURBATION TO THE REGIONAL TISSUES THUS ALLOWING FOR A MEASUREMENT ACCURACY OF BETTER THAN 0.1 DEGREES C AND A RESPONSE TIME OF LESS THAN 2 SECONDS. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WHICH THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IS CONCENTRATED TOWARDS THE FABRICATION AND IN VITRO TESTING OF SUCH A PROBE FOR ITS REPRODUCIBILITY, SENSITIVITY, AND RESPONSE TIME. PRELIMINARY IN VIVO STUDY WILL BE PERFORMED TO RELATE TEMPERATURE TO PERIODONTAL DISEASE ACTIVITY. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARDS THE CLINICAL VALIDATION OF SULCULAR TEMPERATURE CHANGES ACCOMPANYING DISEASE ACTIVITY.

A PROBLEM WHICH IS COMMONLY NOTED IS THE PRESENCE OF UNWANTED IMPURITIES IN THE SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON MATERIAL IN WHICH THE DEVICES ARE FABRICATED. ASIDE FROM HEAVY METALS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY REDUCED TO UNDETECTABLE LEVELS IN CARE- FULLY PREPARED SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON, UNWANTED IMPURITIES INCLUDE OXYGEN, CARBON, BORON, AND PHOSPHORUS. SUCH IMPURITIES ARE INTRODUCED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY THE UBIQUITOUS PRESENCE OF OXYGEN AND CARBON, INCLUDING THE FURNACE COMPONENTS (I.E., SILICON DIOXIDE AND GRAPHITE) USED IN CONVENTIONAL SILICON CRYSTAL GROWTH. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE THE SEGREGATION COEFFICIENT OF PHOSPHORUS IS 0.3 AND THAT OF BORON IS 0.8, THESE IMPURITIES ARE RELATIVELY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM SILICON BY PHYSICAL METHODS DURING CRYSTAL GROWTH. IN THIS PROGRAM, A METHOD IS OUTLINED FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL FOUR OF THESE IMPURITIES BY REACTION WITH RARE EARTH METALS TO FORM THE RARE EARTH OXIDES, CARBIDES, BORIDES, AND PHOSPHIDES, ALL OF WHICH ARE HIGH-MELTING SOLIDS WITH LARGE FREE ENERGIES OF FORMATION.

UNTIL NOW THIS RESOURCE HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITED, LARGELY BECAUSE DURABLE, LOW-COST MATERIALS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST FOR MAKING INFRARED-TRANSPARENT GLAZINGS. WITHOUT SUCH A GLAZING, THE RADIATOR SURFACE COOLS WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SKY BUT REGAINS MUCH OF THE HEAT CONVECTIVELY BY COOLING THE OUTDOOR AIR. THIS REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF \"COOLING POWER\" AVAILABLE TO DISPLACE THE BUILDING'S THERMAL LOAD. THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A POLYMER FILM ABOUT 1 MM THICK WITH HIGH INFRARED TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN 8 AND 13 UM. HIGH- AND LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE FILMS EXHIBIT THE HIGHEST INFRARED TRANSMITTANCE OF ALL POLYMERS WITHIN THIS REGION BUT FALL SHORT OF THE DESIRED GOAL BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF ABSORBING NONETHYLENE GROUPS INCORPOR- ATED IN THE CHAIN. PURE POLYETHYLENE RESINS (WITHOUT ADDITIVES) WILL BE OBTAINED FROM MAJOR MANUFACTURERS AND SUBJECTED TO A VARIETY OF CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL TREATMENTS TO REDUCE THE DETRIMENTAL INFRARED ABSORBANCE CAUSED BY SHORT-BRANCHING SIDE CHAINS AND THE PRESENCE OF UNSATURATED GROUPS IN THE POLYMER CHAIN.

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENSION TO CELL WASHING OF A NEW CORE TECHNOLOGY OF BLOOD SEPARATE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED AT HEMASCIENCE LABORATORIES, SANTA ANA, CALIFORNIA. THE BASIS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS A REVOLUTIONARY NEW TECHNIQUE TO EXPOSE A MEMBRANE FILTER TO A FLUID CONTAINING ELEMENTS TO BE FILTERED. EXTERNAL INERTIAL FORCES ARE USED TO PREVENT FORMED ELEMENTS IN THE BLOOD FROM ADHERING TO THE MEMBRANE. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW REDUCTION OF THE SURFACE AREA OF THE MEMBRANE FILTER FROM 10 TO 100 TIMES THAT USED IN CURRENT BLOOD FILTRATION SYSTEMS BASED ON FLAT PLATE AND HOLLOW FIBER TECHNOLOGIES AND THEREFORE PERMIT SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION. THE TECHNOLOGY IS CONTINUOUS AS OPPOSED TO THE BATCH OPERATION SO IT IS INHERENT FASTER THAN EXISTING DEVICES IN ITS PROCESSING TIME AND NO WASHED PRODUCT IS LOST. WE BELIEVE THAT IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE DEGLYCEROLIZATION OF FROZEN BLOOD, AUTOTRANSFUSION AND FRESH WASH OF BLOOD PRIOR TO TRANSFUSION.

MEMBRANE PROCESSES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATLY REDUCING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL SEPARATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO WIDER USE OF GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES IS THE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING SUFFICIENTLY SELECTIVE MEMBRANES WITH AN ECONOMICALLY HIGH ENOUGH GAS FLUX. BECAUSE STAGING MEMBRANE MODULES (WHICH WOULD ENABLE OPERATION WITH LOW-SELECTIVITY, HIGH-FLUX MEMBRANES) HAVE NOT PROVED ECONOMICAL, MEMBRANES ARE MADE OF HIGH-SELECTIVITY, LOW-PERMEABILITY POLYMERS FORMED INTO VERY THIN LAYERS OF INCREASED GAS TRANSPORT RATES. WITH CURRENT, ANISOTROPIC MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY, MEMBRANES WITH BARRIER LAYERS ABOUT 0.1MM CAN BE MADE. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE OF GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES DEPEND ON DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE EVEN THINNER, MORE SELECTIVE MEMBRANES. IMPROVED MEMBRANES FOR HYDROGEN SEPARATION ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE FORESEEN FOR HYDROGEN IN SYNFUELS PROCESSING, IN CHEMICAL PRODUCTION FROM SYNTHESIS GAS, IN AMMONIA PRODUCTION, AND IN BOTTOM- OF-THE-BARREL UPGRADING. A NEW APPROACH TO MAKING GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES FOR HYDROGEN RECOVERY IS PLANNED, WHICH COUPLES THE PROVEN CAPABILITY OF GLOW DISCHARGE POLYMERIZATION TO DEPOSIT FLAWLESS, THIN COATINGS WITH A NOVEL SUBSTRATE.

A REVIEW OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY'S (EPA) \"SAFE SLUDGE\" DESIGNATION FOR USE IN FOOD PRODUCTION SHOWS THAT NEARLY HALF OF ALL SLUDGES GENERATED CANNOT BE DEFINED AS \"SAFE,\" THUS ELIMINATING THE COST-EFFECTIVE ULTIMATE DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVE OF LAND APPLICATION. A PROCESS THAT COULD ELIMINATE THE TOXIC CONSTITUENTS OF SLUDGE WOULD BE OF B BENEFIT TO MANY MUNICIPALTIES AND INDUSTRIES. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS DEVELOPED A PROCESS THAT PROMISES TO BE CAPABLE OF DETOXIFYING SEWAGE SLUDGE IN A COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER. THIS PROJECT OUTLINES THE NEXT PHASE THAT IS NEEDED TO BRIDGE RESEARCH INFORMATION WITH COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. AEROBIC DIGESTION WITH UNIQUE HIGHLY EFFICIENTSELF-ASPIRATING AERATORS WAS SHOWN TO BE CAPABLE OF AUTOHEATING SLUDGES TO PASTEURIZATION TEMPERATURES (50 CT) BY JEWELL IN A FULL SCALE FACILITY IN 1979. FUTHER DEVELOPMENT SHOWED THAT MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROCESS HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF REMOVING PATHOGENS, TOXIC METALS, AND POSSIBLY TOXIC ORGANICS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE SIMPLE PROCESS. AUTOHEATING SLURRY TEMPERATURES CAN EASILY ACHIEVE 60 C WITH MOST SLUDGES WITHOUT HEAT ENERGY ADDITONS (HIGHER TEMPERATURES WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH HEAT EXCHANGERS), THUS KILLING ALL PATH OGENS. MANIPULATION OF THE PH IN THESE HOT AEROBIC SLURRIES SHOWED THAT GREATER THAN 80% OFMOST TOXIC METAL COULD RAPIDLY SOLUBILIZED (IN LESS THAN 3 HOURS). ALTHOUGH NOT TESTED, AERATION AT THESE TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY RESULT INVOLATIONLIZATION OF SOME TOXIC ORGANICS. FINALLY, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE PROCESS COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO ANAEROBICAL LY DIGESTED SLUDGE. THIS LATER APPLICATION IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LARGE INSTALLED DIGESTION CAPACITY, BUT SHORT TERM AERATION (6 HOURS) OF ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED SL SLUDGE RESULTS IN RAPID TEMPERATURE INCREASES, AND SIGN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SETTLEABILITY AND DEWATERING CHARACTERISTICS THUS ACHIEVING UP TO 50% VOLUME REDUCTION. THUS A HYPOTHETICAL SYSTEM WITH HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME OF LESS THAN 24 HOURS SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF NOT ONLY SUBSTANT IALLY REDUCING SLUDGE VOLUMES, BUT PRODUCE A SLUDGE THAT WO WOULD MEET EPA'S \"SAFE\" DESIGNATION FOR VIRTUALLY ALL ORGANIC SLUDGES EITHER AS AN ADD-ON PROCESS OR AS A NEW INSTALLATION. THIS STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE UN UNIQUE SELF-ASPIRATING AERATORS ON THE SETTLEABILITY, DEWATERABILITY, AUTOHEATING, AND METAL REMOVAL CHARACTER ISTICS OF ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED SEWAGE SLUDGE IN A 28M3 FULL SCALE UNIT LOCATED AT THE BINGHAMTON, NY, SEWAGE TRE TREATMENT FACILITY (A 190 MILLION 1/D CAPACITY PLANT).

USING THIS TECHNOLOGY THE RSA IS INVARIABLY PRESENT AND ACCURATELY QUANTIFIABLE IN ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF AGE. ITS AMPLITUDE FALLS PREDICTABLY APPROXIMATELY 10% PER DECADE. INDIVIDUALS WITH A TRANSPLANTED HEART OR SEVERE DIABETIC NEUROPATHY HAVE RESTING RSA THAT IS NORMAL FOR AGE. THE SHAPE AND AMPLITUDE OF THE RSA DURING VOLUNTARY CARDIORESPIRATORY SYNCHRONIZATION (VCRS) MAY REFLECT THE COMPLIANCE OF THE HEART MUSCLE AND ITS RESPONSE TO RHYTHMICALLY CHANGING INTRATHORACIC VOLUME, PRESSURE, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EBB AND FLOW OF VENOUS RETURN. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS OBJECTIVE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOLOGIC AGE OF THE HEART AND ALSO THE EFFECT OF ANY DRUG, DISEASE, OR BEHAVIOR THAT AFFECTS THE RSA. BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC-CUMULATIVE CARDIOTOXIC EFFECTS OF ANTHRACYCLINES ARE READILY MEASURED USING THIS DEVICE. RSA DISAPPEARS ACUTELY FOLLOWING INTRAVENOUS DOXORUBICIN ADMINISTRATION, AND GRADUALLY RETURNS TOWARD PRETREATMENT VALUES DURING THE 30 DAYS FOLLOWING DRUG ADMINISTRATION. AN IRREVERSIBLE PROGRESSIVE FALL-OFF OF RSA (AVERAGING 7% PER 60 MG/M2 DOSE) ALSO ACCOMPANIES INCREASING CUMULATIVE DOXORUBICIN DOSAGE. RSA IS INVARIABLY UNDETECTABLE IN PATIENTS WITH PROVEN DOXORUBICIN-INDUCED CARDIOMYOPATHY. DETERMINATION OF RSA BY THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY PERMITS INSTANTANEOUS, NONINVASIVE, QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF CARDIOTOXICITY INDUCED BY DOXORUBICIN.

THE APPROACH INVOLVES: 1) CREATION OF A NEW CONDUCTIVE MOIETY COMBINING THE EMP CONDUCTIVE EFFICIENCIES OF SILVER AND/OR GOLD WITH GLASS SPHERES AND/OR HOLLOW GLASS BEADS TO OBTAIN A COATED MATERIALS WITH EMP CONDUCTIVE PROPERTIES EQUAL TO SILVER AND GOLD AT APPROXIMATELY ONE-SEVENTH THE LOADING WITH SUPERIORDENSITY AND VOLUME CONCENTRATION. 2) INCORPORATION AND STABILIZATION OF THESE MATERIALS TO ACHIEVE EMP RESISTANT COATINGS THAT CAN BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO NEW OR USED EQUIPMENT, FACILITY WALLS, OR FABRIC, TO CREATE A PORTABLE EMP SHROUD OR EMP \"FREE\" ZONE. 3) THE LAST PROJECT EFFORT IS TO OPTIMIZE THE HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE NEW FILLER. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SHALL INCLUDE LOW DENSITY (> 1.0 GM/CC), WHICH WILL CAUSE THE CONDUCTIVE SPHERES TO FLOAT TO THE SURFACE OF THE CONDUCTIVE INTERFACE. THIS WILL OPTIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM BY ALLOWING EVEN LOWER CONCENTRATIONS OF SILVER TO BE USED, WHILE CONCENTRATING CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS AT THE EMP ACTIVE SURFACES."}, {"title": "FACILITY DESIGN ", "Agency": "Department of Defense", "Branch": "Air Force", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "2175", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$50,229.00", "Phase": "Phase I", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1985", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "National Technical Systems", "company address": "1650 S Pacific Coast Hwy, Redondo Beach, CA, 90277", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "DR GEORGE CLARK", "Phone": "(213) 316-2257"}, "Business Contact": {"Phone": "() -"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "IT IS PROPOSED TO DESIGN A TEST FACILITY AND DEVELOP A TESTING PLAN FOR A HYPERVELOCITY PROJECTILE LAUNCHER FACILITY AND FOR A TARGET IMPACT FACILITY.
