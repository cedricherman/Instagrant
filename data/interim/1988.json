TO IMPROVE COMPONENT LIFETIME, MATERIALS HAVING INCREASED RESISTANCE TO CORROSION DEGRADATION UNDER OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS ARE REQUIRED. ALLOYS THAT PRODUCE PROTECTIVE OXIDES ON THEIR SURFACE ARE WIDELY UTILIZED FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS. ALPHA-ALUMINA IS ONE OF SEVERAL METAL OXIDES THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR ALLOYS AGAINST SULFIDATION ATTACK UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOUND IN FOSSIL ENERGY SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE ALPHA-ALUMINA SCALE USUALLY HAS POOR ADHESION AND THUS HAS LIMITED PROTECTION CAPABILITIES, PARTICULARLY IN APPLICATIONS SUBJECT TO THERMAL CYCLING. A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING THE ADHERENCE OF METAL OXIDE SCALES TO THEIR SUBSTRATE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED PREVIOUSLY IN FERRITIC ALLOYS. THE TECHNIQUE INVOLVES THE GENERATION OF A NITRIDEDLAYER ON THE SURFACE OF THE BASE MATERIAL PRIOR TO EXPOSURE TO THE OXIDIZING ENVIRONMENT. INCOHERENT NITRIDES IN THE SURFACE LAYERS SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVE THE ADHERENCE OF THE OXIDE SCALE, RESULTING IN IMPROVED SPALLING RESISTANCE AND LEADING TO EXTENDED SERVICE LIFETIMES. THIS PROJECT WILL ATTEMPT TO USE THESE PRINCIPLES TO IMPROVE THE SCALE ADHERENCE, AND THUS THE SERVICE LIFETIME, OF FE-CR-AL ALLOYS.

THE SENSOR IS A PART OF A CALIBRATION SYSTEM WHICH IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF THE ROBOT'S TRAJECTORY AT ITS END POSITION AND ORIENTATION (POSE). A CORRECTION ALGORITHM IS USED TO GENERATE JOINT CORRECTIONS WHICH, WHEN ADDED TO THE NOMINAL JOINT SOLUTIONS DETERMINED BY THE ROBOT'S CONTROLLER, MAKE THE ACHIEVED POSE EQUAL TO THAT DESIRED. THE CORRECTION ALGORITHM REQUIRES THAT A MODEL OF THE ACTUAL ROBOT LINKAGE BE DETERMINED. FASTMAN'S SYSTEM DETERMINES THAT MODEL USINGA SERIES OF ACCURATE POSE MEASUREMENTS AND A CALIBRATION ALGORITHM DEVELOPED BY THE OWNERS OF FASTMAN. THE POSE MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE USING THE INEXPENSIVE POSE SENSOR, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE CALIBRATION SYSTEM ALLOWS POSES GENERATED BY TASK PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THOSE GENERATED ONLINE OR OFFLINE, TO BESTORED AS QUALIFIED POSES.

OUR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE FOURFOLD: DEFINE OPTIMAL CULTURE CONDITIONS AND SELECT STRAINS OF OIL-PRODUCING ALGAE WHICH EXHIBIT EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH IN 99.7% D2O. IDENTIFY PROCEDURES FOR EFFICIENT HARVEST OF THE CULTURES, EXTRACTION OF THE PERDEUTERATED OILS AND RECYCLING OF THE D2O. CHARACTERIZE THE LIPID COMPONENTS PRODUCED BY THE PIL-PRODUCING ALGAE DURING CULTURE IN D2O. DESIGN A TEST BED FOR COMPARISON OF THE LUBRICATION CAPABILITIES OF THE OILS EXTRACTED FROM THE ALGAE.

FIRST, THE PRECISION QUARTZ MOLDS ARE DESTROYED AFTER FIRST USE AND ARE THEREFORE NOT COST EFFICIENT. ALSO, THE QUARTZ BECOMES SLIGHTLY RADIOACTIVE DURING SOLIDIFICATION; THE BROKEN MOLDS THEREFORE CONSTITUTE RADIATIVE WASTE, WHICH MUST BE SAFELY STORED OR REPROCESSED.

NEXT, THE CRITICAL CURRENT IS REDUCED TO THE TARGET VALUE OF A FEW MICROAMPERES MAGNETICALLY, USING THE PROPERTIES OF OXIDE SUPERCONDUCTOR GRAIN BOUNDARIES. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF MAGNECICALLY CONTROLLING THE CRITICAL CURRENT IN A WEAK LINKIN BULK OXIDE. THE DEMONSTRATION WILL CLEAR ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES ON THE PATH TO PRODUCTION OF PRACTICAL SQUIDSYSTEMS OPERATING IN LIQUID NITROGEN."}, {"title": "OPTICAL HOLOGRAPHIC INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS FOR PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING ", "Agency": "Department of Energy", "Branch": "N/A", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "7813", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$50,000.00", "Phase": "Phase I", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1988", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION", "company address": "2545 West 237th Street, Suite B, Torrance, CA, 90505", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "PETER YEUNG", "Phone": "() -"}, "Business Contact": {"Name": "PETER YEUNG", "Phone": "(213) 530-1416"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "N/A"}, {"title": "READ/WRITE/ERASE MEMORY SYSTEMS FROM COMPOSITES GRAFT POLYMERS ", "Agency": "Department of Energy", "Branch": "N/A", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "7769", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$50,000.00", "Phase": "Phase I", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1988", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION", "company address": "2545 West 237th Street, Suite B, Torrance, CA, 90505", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "PETER YEUNG", "Phone": "() -"}, "Business Contact": {"Name": "PETER YEUNG", "Phone": "(213) 530-1416"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "N/A"}, {"title": "OPTICAL SENSOR FOR DETECTION OF SODIUM LEAK FROM A POOL-TYPE LIQUID METAL COOLED REACTOR VESSEL ", "Agency": "Department of Energy", "Branch": "N/A", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "9349", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$49,951.00", "Phase": "Phase I", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1988", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "PHYSICAL RESEARCH, INC.", "company address": "25500 Hawthorne Blvd., Suite 2300, Torrance, CA, 90505", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "Dr. Dariush Modarress", "Title": "Principal Investigator", "Phone": "(213) 378-1056"}, "Business Contact": {"Phone": "() -"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "N/A"}, {"title": "HIGH TEMPERATURE LDV SEED PARTICLE DEVELOPMENT ", "Agency": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "Branch": "N/A", "Contract": "N/A", "Agency Tracking Number": "6775", "Socially and Economically Disadvantaged": "N", "Amount": "$49,436.00", "Phase": "Phase I", "Program": "SBIR", "Awards Year": "1988", "Solicitation Year": "N/A", "Solicitation Topic Code": "N/A", "Solicitation Number": "N/A", "HUBZone Owned": "N", "Woman Owned": "N", "company name": "Physical Sciences Inc.", "company address": "Dascomb Res Park Po Box 3100, Andover, MA, 01810", "DUNS": "N/A", "Principal Investigator": {"Name": "DR MICHAEL B FRISH", "Phone": "() -"}, "Business Contact": {"Phone": "() -"}, "Research Institution": "N/A", "Abstract": "TO PERFORM LASER DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY IN THE GAS FLOWS OF AEROSPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS, LIGHT SCATTERING PARTICLES ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE HARSH AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT ARE NEEDED.

ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT MAJOR EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY TOWARD THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SSC DIPOLES AND QUADRUPOLES, THE CORRECTION MAGNETS POSE A DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES. FIRST OF ALL, THESE MAGNETS MUST BE PACKED IN A SMALL SPACE, WHICH REQUIRES CAREFUL COMPACTING IN THE COIL PACKAGE. SECONDLY, THESE MAGNETS REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL CURRENT CONTROLS, SO EACH MAGNET REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL LEADS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CURRENT MUST BE KEPT LOW, IN THE RANGE OF 50 TO 100 A, IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE HELIUM BOIL-OFF. THIRDLY, THE USE OF SMALL WIRES MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TO WIND THESE MAGNETS SO THAT THEY WILL NOT REQUIRE TRAINING.

THERE ARE THREE TECHNIQUES BY WHICH THE FLOW RATE CAN BE MODIFIED: ACCUMULATOR EFFECT, MASS ADDITION AND FLOW RESTRICTION. THE ACCUMULATOR EFFECT IS THE RESULT OF EXPANSION OF PRESSURIZED GASES IN THE GAS GENERATOR VOLUME. THE MASS ADDITION IS BASED ON INJECTION MASS, EITHER SOLID, LIQUID OR GAS, INTO THE BURNING VOLUME. RESTRICTED FLOW IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT GAS GENERATORS WILL BURN AT A FASTER RATE AT THE ELEVATED PRESSURE INDUCED BY RESTRICTING THE EXHAUST FLOW.

RESEARCH INTO OXYGEN STORAGE AND GENERATION METHODS IS NEEDED TO OFFER SAFE, RELIABLE SYSTEMS FOR THESE MISSILE BASES. PAST STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT STORING OXYGEN AS A CRYOGENIC LIQUID (LOX) IS DANGEROUS AND THAT OXYGEN STORED IN THE FORM OF A SOLID, AS SODIUM CHLORATE CANDLES, OFFERS AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO LOX. FOR THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE TO REVIEW AND ANALYZE THE FEASIBILITY OF STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN IN CHLORATE CANDLES WHICH WOULD GENERATE OXYGEN SAFELY ON DEMAND.
