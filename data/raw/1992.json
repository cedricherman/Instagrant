THE MOTIVATION IS THAT POLYMERS OFTEN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF WEIGHT AND/OR COST. HOWEVER, THE DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS IS A LIMITING FACTOR IN MANY APPLICATIONS. THE THERMAL DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN POLYMER PROCESSING AND IN FIRE SAFETY, WHILE THE BIODEGRADATION BEHAVIOR IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. TO DESCRIBE THE DEGRADATION OF POLYMERS, ONE NEEDS TO KNOW THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND RATESFOR THE BOND BREAKING AND CROSSLINKING REACTIONS.

A SIMILAR CONDUCTOR DESIGN THAT USED (NBTI)3SN (NIOBIUM-TITANIUM-TIN) WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LABORATORY FOR USE IN THEIR POP COIL PROGRAM. THIS CONDUCTOR, WHICH WAS PRODUCED IN LARGE QUANTITIES, SUFFERED FROM POOR AND VARIABLE PIECELENGTHS. ALTHOUGH THE EXACT REASON FOR THIS DIFFERENCE IN BEHAVIOR ISNOT KNOXWN FOR CERTAIN, IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE APPARENT HIGH WORK-HARDENING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TI-CONTAINING ALLOY COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE TA ALLOY.

THE NIOBIUM (NB) BARRIER THICKNESS WAS INTRODUCED IN EARLY SSC CONDUCTORS TO PREVENT INTERACTION BETWEEN COPPER (CU) AND THE NIOBIUM-TITANIUM (NBTI) FILAMENTS. AS MORE AGGRESSIVE HEAT TREATMENTS WERE EMPLOYED AND FILAMENT SIZES WERE REDUCED, THE THICKNESS OF THIS BARRIER BECAME INADEQUATE AND BOTH COPPER AND TITANIUM DIFFUSED THROUGH THE BARRIER.

CURRENTLY, MOST OF THE VOC CONTENT OF WASTEWATERS IS LOST. COMMON WASTEWATER TREATMENT METHODS INCLUDE BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT, INCINERATION, AND DEEP-WELL INJECTION. THESE METHODS ARE USUALLY EXPENSIVE, ENVIRONMENTALLY QUESTIONABLE, OR OPERATIONALLY DIFFICULT. VOC-CONTAINING WASTEWATERS ALSO REPRESENT AN ENORMOUS UNTAPPED RECOVERY OPPORTUNITY SPANNING THE BREADTH OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY. THE TOTAL ENERGY VALUE OF THE VOCS CONTAINED IN WASTEWATERS PRODUCED BY U.S. INDUSTRY IS AT LEAST 200 TO 300 TRILLION BTU/YEAR, AND MAY BE AS HIGH AS 1,000 TRILLION BTU/YEAR.

THE TECHNOLOGY HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED ON CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER FEEDS CONTAINING 1 TO 10 PPM VOCS.

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ARE LIKELY TO PROHIBIT THESE EMISSIONS WITHIN A FEW YEARS. THE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY MUST, THEREFORE, EITHER CONTAIN THESE EMISSIONS OR REPLACE GLYCOL DEHYDRATORS.

DEHYDRATION OF BOTH SMALL AND LARGE NATURAL GAS STREAMS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE BECAUSE OF THE MODULAR NATURE OF MEMBRANE SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, MEMBRANE SYSTEMS ARE MORE COMPACT THAN GLYCOL DEHYDRATORS AND DO NOT NEED THE GAS-FIRED BOILER USED TO REGENERATE THE GLYCOL, TWO IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES FOR OFFSHORE GAS PRODUCTION PLATFORMS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED TWO HYDROPHILIC, RUBBERY POLYMERS WITH OUTSTANDING PROPERTIES AS MATERIALS FOR NATURAL GAS DEHYDRATION MEMBRANES. MEMBRANES PREPARED FROM THESE POLYMERS HAVE VERY HIGH SELECTIVITIES FOR WATER VAPOR OVER NATURAL GAS AND ARE COMPATIBLE WITH NATURAL GAS STREAMS AT PRESSURES OF AT LEAST 1,000 PSIG. ONE OF THE MEMBRANES ALSO HAS GOOD SELECTIVITY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE AND HYDROGEN SULFIDE, WHICH ALLOWS (PARTIAL) ACID GAS REMOVAL IN ADDITION TO DEHYDRATION. THE SELECTIVITIES FOR WATER VAPOR ARE SO HIGH THAT THE SEPARATION ACHIEVED IS LIMITED BY THE AVAILABLE PRESSURE RATIO ACROSS THE MEMBRANE AND THE OCCURRENCE OF BOUNDARY LAYERS ON THE FEED-SIDE MEMBRANE SURFACE. THIS MAKES THE PROPER DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE MEMBRANE SYSTEM CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

SEPARATION OF CO2 FROM FLUE GASES WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND LOWER THE COST OF PROCESSES TO FIX CO2 CHEMICALLY OR OTHERWISE PREVENT ITS DISCHARGE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. SUCH A CO2 TRANSPORT SYSTEM MUST OPERATE AT HIGH EFFICIENCY TO MINIMIZE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND COST OF REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS. PHASE I OF THIS RESEARCH IS INVESTIGATING A NOVEL SYSTEM FOR THE REMOVAL OF CO2 FROM THE FLUE GAS OF COAL-FIRED POWERPLANTS. PREVIOUS WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT REVERSIBLE ELECTROCHEMICAL SEPARATION SYSTEMS ARE POTENTIALLY SIMPLER AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN OTHER APPROACHES. A CRITICAL PART OF THIS SYSTEM IS A CARRIER MOLECULE THAT CAN REVERSIBLY BIND AND RELEASE CO2. UNFORTUNATELY, NO CARRIER THAT CAN BOTH REVERSIBLY BIND CO2 AND RESIST DEGRADATION BY OXYGEN HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE INNOVATION TO BE STUDIED IN THIS RESEARCH IS A NEW CLASS OF CARRIERS THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE STABLE AND MORE REVERSIBLE THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED. PHASE I RESEARCH IS TESTING MEMBERS OF THIS NEW CLASS OF CARRIERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN ELECTROCHEMICALLY TRANSPORTING CO2.

IN MEUF, AN IONIC SURFACTANT, WHICH FORMS AGGREGATES CALLED MICELLES, IS ADDED TO WATER. ORGANIC AND METALLIC SPECIES ASSOCIATE OR BIND WITH THE MICELLES. THE SOLUTION IS THEN TREATED IN AN ULTRAFILTRATION DEVICE WITH MEMBRANE PORE SIZES SMALL ENOUGH TO BLOCK THE PASSAGE OF MICELLES AND THE ASSOCIATED TARGET SOLUTES. THE RESULT IS AN EXTREMELY PURE PERMEATE, AND A VERY CONCENTRATED, LOW-VOLUME RETENTATE FOR DISPOSAL OR MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL ULTIMATE RECOVERY OF THE SOLUTES. UNLIKE MOST ALTERNATIVE METHODS, MEUF CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY REMOVE BOTH ORGANICS AND METALS. REDUCTIONS IN CONCENTRATION OF TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IN ONE PASS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN PRELIMINARY WORK. THE PERCENTAGE REDUCTION DOES NOT DECREASE AS THE FEED SOLUTE CONCENTRATION DECREASES, MAKING THIS TECHNIQUE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN THE REDUCTION OF VERY TOXIC CHEMICALS FROM LOW CONCENTRATIONS TO ULTRALOW CONCENTRATIONS.","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Surfactant Assoc Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF NONLINEAR STRUCTURES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/321932","abstract":"NONLINEAR STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF LARGE-SCALE DYNAMICS PROBLEMS CURRENTLY CAN BE SOLVED ONLY WITH CUMBERSOME, COMPLEX CODES AND THEIR ATTENDANT LENGTHY COMPUTER RUN TIMES.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS UNDERSTANDING OF FUEL BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF TECHNIQUES FOR ON-LINE MEASUREMENT OF DEPOSIT FORMATION. THE PHASE I PROPOSAL IS TO DEVELOP AN EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE DEPOSIT RATE AND COMPOSITION OF SURFACE DEPOSITS FORMED FROM DEGRADATION OF JET FUEL. THE MONITORING SYSTEM WOULD BE BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FT-IR TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY AND A QUARTZ CRYSTAL MASS (QCM) DETECTOR. THE FT-IR DIAGNOSTICS WOULD INVOLVE THE USE OF A FIBER-OPTIC (F-O) ELEMENT OPERATED IN AN ATTENUATED TOTAL REFLECTANCE (ATR) MODE. THE USE OF FIBER-OPTICS HAS PROVIDED THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSMITTING THE IR LIGHT THROUGH A PROCESS STREAM UNDER DIFFICULT OPERATING CONDITIONS (HIGH TEMPERATURE, HIGH PRESSURE). ATR SPECTROSCOPY PROVIDES THE POSSIBILITY OF ANALYSES OF HIGHLY ABSORBING MATERIALS BY PROVIDING A REPRODUCIBLE, SHORT PATH LENGTH. THE QCM DETECTOR CAN MEASURE MICROGRAM QUANTITIES OF DEPOSITS AND THUS CAN PROVIDE REAL TIME DATA ON FUEL DEPOSITION. THE PHASE I RESULT WOULD BE THE DEMONSTRATION OF THESE DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR MEASURING THE ONSET OF FUEL DEGRADATION AND FOR TESTING ADDITIVES.

Although more energetic oxidizers have been demonstrated to exhibit superior performance, they have not been used because of their reactivity with materials and/or their hazards. Mixtures of powerful solid oxidizers with solid oxygen have been found to have greatly reduced reactivity and greatly increased stability. Solid cryogenic oxidizers are one part of what the American Space Exploration Initiative has recently recognized as the nationally critical technology of cryogenics. This proposal describes a solid oxidizer condensed directly into a solid, extruded, formed into pellets, and injected at high pressures. A constant injection rate that minimizes the possibility of combustion instabilities is achieved through mass-dependent pellet spacing. The work described in this proposal provides an example of technology transfer from a well developed specialized field (pellet fueling of fusion plasmas) to a promising new technology. The proposed storage, feed, and digital injection system is expected to be able to satisfy the rigorous requirements for the use of a solid oxidizer propellant.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Thin Film High-Temperature Superconductor Switching Devices on Si Wafers","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/74929","abstract":"Future technology for fast switching HTSC devices will require large-area arrays of thin-film switches and materials and device compatibility with semiconductor devices.

Delta wings with sweep angles of 60 degrees or more will be fitted with the proposed leading-edge device of 3 or more flaps. Each flap is controlled with a high-speed digital linear stepper motor and is capable of executing autonomous oscillations. It is intended to capitalize on excitation of helical instability waves of clockwise and counterclockwise spin on the separated leading-edge vortex to manipulate the pressure distribution along the vortex core. This in turn affects the location of vortex breakdown which could lead to enhanced lift and super-maneuverability of a delta or cropped delta wing aircraft. A parallel effort will be spent on incorporating piezo-electric oscillator/exciters on swept wing leading edges, which will dynamically manipulate camber distribution along the wing span in a 3-D fashion. With the proper choice of the driving frequency (i.e., nondimensional Strouhal number), a resonant flow behavior can be excited, which in turn eliminates the need for large-amplitude leading-edge oscillations. We currently estimate a maximum angular oscillation amplitude of +/- 5 degrees.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"AEROTECH ENGINEERING & RESEARCH CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SYSTEM-OPTIMIZPD, ULTRA LOW-COST, HIGH-STRENGTH FUEL TANKAGE FOR LONG-RANGE MISSILES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/80606","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"AEROTECH ENGINEERING & RESEARCH CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"INFLATABLE SMART MISSILE WING DESIGN EVALUATION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/80612","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"AEROTECH ENGINEERING & RESEARCH CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"COMPUTER BASED TECHNOLOGIES FOR ADVANCED TRAINING SYSTEMS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/80837","abstract":"AETECH WILL PRODUCE AN AUTOMATED TOOL TO ASSIST IN THE DESIGN AND DEVE LOPMENT OF COURSEWARE FOR INTELLIGENT COMPUTER ASSISTED INSTRUCTION SYSTEMS USING ENHANCED HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACES.

The key technical innovation is the development of linear and nonlinear target tracking algorithms using the recent results in H(Infinity) estimation methodology to modify the classical Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter algorithms; these H(Infinity) based tracking algorithms actively hedge against \"worst-case\" target maneuvers and therefore ensure more robust tracking accuracy performance than do classical algorithms. Of particular interest is the version of these H(Infinity) tracking algorithms in which frequent (low data rate) radar measurements of the target(s) are being made, and the constrained target kinematic differential equations (linear or nonlinear) are used for target state prediction between successive measurements Robust prediction of the maneuvering target motion can also be incorporated into the algorithm, because H(Infinity) algorithms take advantage of \"directional\" information which is influenced by the desired prediction time. Phase I will demonstrate the performance improvement of these new tracking algorithms and the performance tradeoffs associated with reducing the data rate and the degree of maneuver acceleration. Phase II will integrate the phase I algorithms with other adaptive features, and demonstrate their performance tradeoffs using both simulated and, perhaps, actual data.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"ALPHATECH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"DIRECTED ENERGY LASAR WEAPON TARGET ASSIGNMENT","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/85515","abstract":"THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPON (DEW) FIRE CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

They would be great for a number of applications such as fins for spacecraft radiators. So why aren't they used more on spacecraft thermal systems? One reason is joining technology. Although many methods such as brazing and adhesives have been developed for joining composites to metals, these methods are generally inadequate for high temperature operation, surviving launch vibration and thermal cycling and all the other \"gotta-haves\" required by spacecraft designers. Space Exploration Associates, teamed with BeamAlloy Corp., propose a radical new method for joining dissimilar materials. The idea is to bombard composite surfaces with metal ions, forming a super-adherent metal layer, which is bonded at the atomic level. Then the metals can be joined by application of pressure and temperature to make a nice, neat, nearly indestructible bond.

MD could potentially offer advantages over conventional distillation, the technology in most common use now, and could offer an alternative to other promising membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis. These potential advantages include small size, simplicity, and low energy requirements. MD is also relatively unaffected by salt concentration, not susceptible to fouling, and produces essentially pure water that does not need further treatment. MD has never been commercialized, primarily because no membrane has yet been developed specifically for this application. To render this technology available for full Navy consideration, we propose to develop an MD membrane and the accompanying module. In Phase I we will investigate the technical feasibility of developing a membrane that, when optimized during Phase II, would meet Navy Specifications for MD. During Phase I this membrane will be incorporated into a first-generation module and tested against the Navy specificatons. The results of this test will indicate whether the membranes are technically feasible and will specific targets for Phase II optimization. The ultimate goal of the program is to commercialize the proposed new technology to meet the needs of the Navy.

Important advantages of the ROV system are that it will allow the Navy to conduct submarine inspection and maintenance operations that previously have either required the ship to be placed in dry dock or the use of divers. The ROV is small and is configured to allow entrance, unencumbered maneuvering, and egress without removal of protective grids and structural elements of the free flood areas. The ROV will be capable of transmitting real time video and other sensor data via an umbilical to a surface or ship-mounted operator control and monitoring station. Simple tools and devices can be fitted to the ROV to allow maintenance activities. The ROV can also be used to position and apply other surface deployed inspection, maintenance and repair tools. The ROV system concept and its operational use meets all Navy safety requirements and is within the capabilities of submarine Intermediate Maintenance Activities (IMAs). The concept incorporates standard Benthos production ROV modules and components minimizing development risk, allowing rapid future finalization and commercialization of the proposed system, and, most importantly, resulting in low cost production systems.

These super thin plastic films will render the battery susceptible to being shaped, cut and molded into any conventional and non-conventional shapes. Due to the absence of liquid electrolyte, this battery will be ruggedized to minimize power loss from punctures, such as bullet holes. The plastics, which we use in this battery, whether conducting or non-conducting, will with- stand temperatures ranging from 30 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

Producibility in ship design is impeded by differing mind-sets about ship design and construction between the Navy and shipyards. Knowledge of potential producibility problems during early ship design would allow changes to be made early, significantly reducing costs. A ship producibility lessons learned intelligent database (L(to the 2nd power)DB) of design and construction knowledge could improve the naval ship design process. This project will develop a user-friendly, interactive, and intelligent database for documenting and tracking design producibility lessons learned. The ultimate objective is to incorporate the L(to the 2nd power)DB with the ship design database currently under development by the Navy. This integration will provide ship designers with on-line access to both design information and design decision ramifications. During Phase I of this effort, the database element relationships for the L(to the 2nd power)DB will be defined, proof-of-concept database and user-interface prototypes will be built, and an intelligent user-interface component will be investigated.

This is due to development methods and computer-aided design tools relying heavily on an informal and inaccurate process for communicating requirements. A methodology and supporting tool set is needed to integrate requirement details with a system's design and analysis. This project proposes an intelligent real-time system assissment tool (ExpeR/T) that integrates requirement specification, systems design, software design, and design assessment. It will provide the client and engineer with an automated tool that suggests design improvements when system model analysis detects problems. ExpeR/T utilizes an innovative combination of methods, techniques and concepts which are currently treated as disjoint and separate issues in the technical literature. It combines the concepts of real-time systems analysis, software structured analysis, and English-like requirements specifications. These concepts are integrated through a combination of artificial intellignece experts system rules, graphical system design, English-like requirements specifications, design analysis, and design modeling/simulation. During Phase I, ExpeR/T requirements will be defined, preliminary design of system design diagram transformation and quality evaluation will be performed, and a proof-of-concept ExpeR/T prototype will be developed.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Conceptual Systems & Software Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"INFRARED DETECTION BY BKB THIN FILMS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/132152","abstract":"THE DISCOVERY OF A MULTITUDE OF SUPERCONDUCTING OXIDE MATERIALS HAS OPENED UP NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR DEVELOPING INFRARED DETECTORS.

Since crystal growth by HEM is carried out wih low temperature gradients, the scattering losses in Cr:LiCAF due to defects and variation in stoichiometry are minimized. The submerged solid-liquid interface in HEM minimizes the breakdown of the interface due to the nonstiochiometric phase. The nonstoichiometric phase is rejected to the last material to solidify which is near the crucible wall. Crystal growth by HEM is achieved without moving the crucible, the heat zone, or the crystal.

Over the year, the increasingly severe demands of modern naval warfare have produced increasingly quiet systems.

Surprisingly, one of the simplest parts of a naval vessel, a simple rubber shock mount, is one of the most unreliable, and be (relative to its purchase price) one of the most expensive to replace. The loss of a vibration shock mount's damping characteristics can result in the reduction in the vessels acoustics, and ultimatly, the loss of the vessel to the fleet when in for repair.

The 3 techniques include 2 long range, relatively low data rate (100-500 and 1200 bits/sec) configurations, and a short range, relatively high data rate, (10 kbit/sec) configuration. The 2 long range configurations are a multiple convergence zone acoustic data telemetry system that uses Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or Digital Coded Phase Modulation (DCPM) at data rates of 100-500 bits/sec, and a system that employs a surface RF buoy to relay acoustic data telemetry from a subsea source that uses Frequency Shift Keying (MF$K) modulation at a data rate of 1200 bits/sec. The 3rd, high data rate technique, is intended for short range, low power, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) applications and uses the QPSK technique at a data rate of 10 kbits/sec. Our evaluation effort will encompass open water tests using existing 1200 bits/sec acoustic modems modified to implement the various modulation schemes and allow us to evaluate various performance factors such as power efficiency, reliability, data accuracy, and transducer design.

The heat pipe facilitates heat transfer into and out of the capsules. The major drawback to using LiH is its high equilibrium hydrogen pressure. Since hydrogen diffuses readily through iron and nickel-based alloys, the expected life time of a heat pipe with a LiH capsule is very low. However, Dynatherm has discovered that the actual hydrogen build-up in a potassium heat pipe with a LiH capsule is much less than predicted. It is postulated that the presence of the alkali metal suppresses hydrogen permeation, probably through the formation of a layer of alkali metal hydride. The objective of Phase I is to verify the initial observation and to quantify the phenomenon. The ultimate objective is to develop alkali metal heat pipes with internal LiH storage which are not sensitive to hydrogen poisoning.

These composites will be bonded to structures like beams and panels to sense and actively damp in-plane strains which cause noise and vibration.

By incorporating the matrix (PEEK yarn) into the triaxial braiding process, to subsequent impregnation step can be eliminated thus resulting in lower costs. The results of this program will provide an automated demonstration of a reproducible thin-walled structural tube.

The problem is that it is difficult to track targets at low elevation because both the target and its reflected image are somtines both in the antenna's main beam. Flam & Russell, Inc.

FR is confident it can solve the problem because it has built modern direction finding systems that specialize in finding signals in multipath. The proposed solution consists of combining the squinted beams available from a monopulse antenna using variants of modern direction finding algorithms and advances in millimeter wave hardware.

Establishing process control requires a foundational underpinning that (a) reflects a complementary integration of maintenance and development activities, (b) the identification and definition of a (semi-) automated data collection and analysis process which employs quality indicators that are definitively linkded to the existance of process and product attributes, the use of acceptable software engineering principles, and (c) the formulation and use of control methods that are designed to work within the defined automated process and to provide decision support capabilities.

It is desired to optimize the average tracking performance over all seeker/target aspect angles, or preferably, to optimize performance at each required operational aspect angle. The proposal detailed herein describes the use of digital beamforming (DBF) arrays as a means to allow the aperture illumination to be optimized at each aspect angle in the presence of symmetrical or asymmetrical blockage such as presented by an IR seeker. The DBF concept also allows for individual optimization of the sum and difference pattern weights of a monopulse tracking seeker.

Due to the harsh environment to which those fasteners are subjected locking systems for threaded connections are seriously critical to aircraft integrity. The most challenging environmental issue is the timperature range (-65F to +800F) in which the thread locking system must perform. Aircraft of mie-twentieth century design relied heavily on mechanical locking techniques, such as lockwires and castellated nuts, but the skill and time required for proper installation is excessive. Later, locking nuts fitted with nylon patches of rings were developed, however the inferent problems of limited temperature range and low reusability have not been surmounted. Likewise, all-metal self-locking nuts have serious shortcomings, skuch as limited vibration resistance and mechanical thread destruction. The proposed effort employs shape memory alloy (SMA) as the licking mechanism. By cleverly exploiting the recovery of SMA to its original form, adaptive locking mechanisms can be developed that provide extensive allowable reuse, a preatly enhanced temperature range, and superior locking force for improved vibration dampoing.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"FOSTER-MILLER, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Superior Gr/Cu SEM-D Heat Sink","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/169225","abstract":"1In submarine electronics modules, heat dissipated by electronic devices is typically transported along the length of the heat sink (upon which ICs are mounted) to the water cooled side walls.

Foster-Miller will demonstrate an innovative Gr/Cu metal matrix composite (MMC) heat sink which offers a 25 percent reduction in thermal impedance over the current copper component. The key bottleneck for MMCa-low z-directional conductivity-will be removed by adding z-directional fibers to the planar preform using a Foster-Miller proprietary process. Additionally, the MMC heat sink will have a tailored planar CTE in the card region (thereby obviating a complaint layer) and high planar thermal conductivity. The cumulative effect will be a 6 to 10 C reduction in the device junction temperature (thereby >50 percent reduction in device failure rate) for the same power density, or alternatively, a 25 percent increase in the power dissipation at current device junction temperatures. Additionally, the 45 percent lighter Gr/Cu heat sink will accrue significant savings in the electronics system and structural weight.

Our initial tests results indicate that the method has the potential to significantly reduce delamination in carbon-epoxy, and also to eliminate or reduce some of the problems related to mechanical fasteners. We have recently shown that through thickness (T2) reinforcement with carbon fibers improves mode I fracture toughness ten times in AS4/3501-6. Unlike stitching, the method does not adversely affect the in-plane properties.

The method should be capable of noncontact measuring of surface stresses, scanning and recording stress fields due to static and dynamic loads, and producing color stress plots which can be compared to finite element analysis. A portable PC-based ultrasonic C-scan instrument with air-coupled transducers is proposed to meet these specifications. Ultrasonics provides a direct relationship between the elastic properties of materials, which encompasses stress, and sound wave propagation. This relationship is readily modeled, predicted, and quantified using finite element analysis.

MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH, INC. (MTR) HAS BEEN DEVELOPING MEMBRANE-BASED CFC/AIR SEPARATION SYSTEMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAS INSTALLED A NUMBER OF SMALL COMMERCIAL UNITS. THESE UNITS ARE ABLE TO REMOVE 98-99% OF CFC VAPORS FROM EFFLUENT AIR STREAMS, PRODUCING A CONCENTRATED CFC-CONTAINING PERMEATE STREAM THAT CAN BE RECYCLED. MTR BELIEVES THAT MEMBRANE-BASED SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS OF THIS TYPE WOULD FORM AN IDEAL BASIS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTALLY ACCEPTABLE SYSTEMS THAT DOD REQUIRES. MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY HAS MANY COMPELLING ADVANTAGES OVER CARBON ADSORPTION OR CRYOGENIC RECOVERY. IN THE PHASE I PORTION OF THIS PROGRAM, MTR PROPOSES TO SELECT AN EXISTING SPRAY BOOTH/VAPOR DEGREASER SYSTEM THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO ACCEPT A TAILOR-MADE MEMBRANE SOLVENT RECOVERY AND RECYCLE SYSTEM. A COMPLETE DESIGN FOR THIS UNIT INCLUDING APPROPRIATE EMISSIONS MONITORING INSTRUMENTATION WILL BE PREPARED. IN THE PHASE II PROGRAM, THE COMPLETE UNIT WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED AND EVALUATED, FIRST IN THE LABORATORY AND LATER AT A DOD SITE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 300,000 TONS OF SOLVENT ARE EMITTED BY SOLVENT-CLEANING OPERATIONS ANNUALLY. A SPRAY BOOTH FITTED WITH MEMBRANE SYSTEMS TO ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE SOLVENT EMISSIONS AND RECOVER THE SOLVENT FOR REUSE WOULD FIND NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE AEROSPACE, ELECTRONICS, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND OTHER \"HIGH-TECH\" INDUSTRIES.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1992,"firm":"MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"RECOVERY OF CFCS AND HALONS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/229742","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1992,"firm":"MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SUPERIOR FIBER INSERTS FOR NUTS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/229822","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Memry Technologies, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"REAL-TIME SENSOR DATA FUSION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/230059","abstract":"TRACKING SADARM SUBMUNITIONS FOR TEST EVALUATION IS A DIFFICULT TASK.

Being full-field, non-contacting, and not requiring installing strain gages, the technique appears to have the potential for development into a practical technique for nondestructive evaluation of large objects such as submarine. Despite being a young technique, shearography has already been accepted by the rubber industry for nondestructive evaluation of tires, and by the aerospace industry for nondestructive evaluation composite materials. The proposed investigation aims to prove the feasibility of extending shearography to inspecting rubber to metal bonds.

Concentrating on those critical elements, favorable CE methodologies will be augmented with a CE expert system to provide a CE assistant usable for ship design trade-offs in early program phases. Augmentation includes the structure of a corporate data base of program LCC experience across programs, use of operational simulators to expand the experience base with synthetic data from \"what-if\" scenarios, and navigation and parameter generation help to interface to specialty engineering models throughout DoD and industrial organizations. Approaches to acquire and preprocess actual O&S data will also be identified.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"NEOTERIC TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SEISMIC WAVEFORM CHARACTER REPESENTATION USING WAVELET TRANSFORM","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/247136","abstract":"NETROLOGIC WILL USE THE CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM TO OPERATE ON SEISMIC SIGNALS IN PHASE I.

THE PROBLEM IS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE (1) EVERY THREAT SOURCE HAS MANY CLASSES OF ASSOCIATED ACOUSTIC EVENTS, AND (2) THE UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENT HAS AN EVEN GREATER NUMBER OF INTERFERENCE ACOUSTIC EVENTS, SUCH AS THOSE FROM BIOLOGICS. ORINCON HAS FOUND THROUGH EXPERIEMENTS WITH ACTUAL TRANSIENT DATA THAT NO SINGLE SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE CAN CREATE SUFFICIENT FEATURES TO ENABLE ONE TO DISTINGUISH UNIQUELY AMONG THE LARGE CLASSES OF TRANSIENTS. RATHER, SEVERAL TECHNIQUES ARE REQUIRED TO GENERATE METRICS FROM WHICH TRANSIENTS CAN BE CLASSIFIED.

Current problem solutions use relatively simple metrics to characterize changes in recorded data. The approaches are model-based and of limited utility. In many cases, the interaction of fault conditions with the mechanical system is time-varying and highly nonlinear. Specifying a good analytic model is at best difficult and most likely impossible. An alternative solution is to use neural nets coupled with appropriate feature extractors. Neural nets have been used extensively and successfully at ORINCON to solve detection and classification problems in underwater acoustics. Neural networks assume no underlying model for the events of interest. Rather, the neural netork \"learns\" to detect and classify faults by examination of features from training data which have known fault conditions. In Phase I, ORINCON will develop a prototype system that uses three feature extractors coupled with a multilayer perceptron neural net to solve the problem. The three features selected are well suited for characterization of the expected fault classes. We will demonstrate the prototype system processing real data supplied by Westland Helicopters.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Multistatic Active Sonar: Contact Association and Data Fusion","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260404","abstract":"1With the advent of bistatic and multistatic active sonar systems, innovative techniques are required to maintain association of acquired and reacquired contacts. Contact association and data fusion will address three issues. The first issue concerns processing on a single receive platform, where incorrect associations of the Multistatic System Sonar (MSS) Sequential Detector are detected and corrected by the Geographic tracker. The second issue will address multiple receive platforms, with consort data fusion processing occurring on a single receive platform. ORINCON proposes to modify the MSS Information Processor (IP) to examine the performance and effectiveness of single hypothesis trackers (SHT) versus multiple hypothesis trackers (MHT) in the bistatic and multistatic operating environment. For the third issue, ORINCON will identify a method of recognizing and removing range-ambiguous contacts in the tracker, thereby reducing one false alarm contributor. ORINCON will identify performance enhancements over the current MSS tracker algorithm and demonstrate that a MHT tracker operating on ownship data and single hypothesis track data transfers from other receivers can provide better performance that single hypothesis trackers linked together.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SIGNAL DECOMPOSITION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260712","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Command, Control and Communications Systems/Subsystems","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260714","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"CORRELATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS EFFECTS DATA TO DIRECTED AND KINETIC EFFECTS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260761","abstract":"SEVERAL DIRECTED (DE) AND KINETIC ENERGY (KE) WEAPON TECHNOLOGIES ARE PRESENTLY IN THE LABORATORY, EITHER AS DESIGN CONCEPTS OR PROTOTYPE MODELS.

In the interconnection hierarchy, backplane interconnnections impose the most serious speed limitations on 3-D optoelectronic computing systems. Physical Optics Corp proposes an Active Optical Backplane (AOB) which will upgrade the architecture of 3-D optoelectronic computing systems and produce much higher modulation speeds (to 1000 Gbit/sec) among processing elements. When compared with existing electronic backplanes (EB) and Passive Optical Backplanes, the AOB has the same advantage of system compatibility as EBs while keeping the modulation speed projected for POBs. Unlike POBs, the proposed AOB performs both modulation and demodulation on the backplane itself. As a result, the electronic packaging issue is automatically solved without modifying existing connectors from card boards to the backplane. Among all backplane buses investigated, Futurebus+ has the widest data bit width (up to 128 bits), and highest user acceptability. Futurebus+ will be incorporated into this program. Phase I will demonstrate a AOB with on-board modulation and demodulation, with physical layers and protocol in Phase II.","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Voltage Controlled Wide Angular Range Optical Beam Steering Device","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/271438","abstract":"The proposed beam steering technique merges high efficiency wide bandwidth diffraction gratings with liquid crystal cells.

Though slower than acoustooptic beam deflectors, the proposed device offers greater versatility in its angular deflection, significantly smaller power consumption, and less bulky packaging at a lower cost.

Conventional EO modulators suffer from small modulation bandwidths (usually much less than 100 GHz) due to the large walk-off between the propagation of the microwaves and optical waves. Additionally, the small index modulation associated with linear electrooptic coefficients requires a long electrode length (mm to cm). The proposed plasmon waveguide modulator, in conjunction with an EO polymer, provides a modulation scheme that has a small interaction length (about 100 um). No dispersion between the optical waves and the microwaves is expected. Employment of a collinear microstrip line generates a much better overlap integral between the optical and microwave signals, and power consumption is reduced in comparison with conventional coplanar electrode structures used for LiNbO3 and GaAs EO modulators. The optical bandwidth is greatly enhanced by adjusting the input coupling angle and the bouncing angle of the substrate-guided wave, which has a continuous guiding spectrum as long as the total internal reflection (TIR) criterion is satisfied. A plasmon waveguide modulator will be demonstrated in Phase I. The microstrip line suitable for transmitting a 100 GHz signal will also be tested.","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"FOURIER-PLANE HOLOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATIVE FILTER BASED COMPACT OPTICAL CORRELATOR FOR TARGET RECOGNITION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/271444","abstract":"Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to apply its Fourier-plan Holographic Associative Filter (FPHAF) based optical correlator to high speed target identification.

Diffraction-free beams are not subject to transverse spreading (diffraction), in sharp contrast with the currently used Gaussian-profile directed energy beams which undergo significant spreading along the propagation direction. POC's approach is to first generate the diffraction-free beam with the conventional slit-lens method, and then record the interference pattern of the diffraction-free beam and a Gaussian beam as a volume phase hologram using POC's proprietary volume holographic technology. When such a volume hologram is illuminated by a Gaussian beanm from a directed energy laser, it converts most of the incident light into a diffraction-free beam. Using POC's volume holographic technology, the conversion efficiency can potentially reach 99%, significantly better than existing methods. If the proposed research is successful, the practical use of diffraction-free beams can become possible. Such beams provide energy transport efficiency several orders of magnitude higher than Gaussian beams, and can give rise to a new generation of directed energy systems featuring ultrahigh energy transport efficiency, low energy budget, lower cost beam control equipment, and real-time capability.","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Unity Power Factor Power Supply Using Active Correction Solid State Input Conditioner","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/271476","abstract":"1The Phase I work will investigate the feasibility of designing unity power factor high power supplies.

After observing that the radiant heat depends linearly on the effective emissivity of the electrode pair, a method of reducing this parasitic heat loss was developed. For the typical case of tungsten emitter and niobium collector, this effective emissivity is 0.17 to 0.20. Some materials such as copper and sodium have total emissivities less than 0.10 for the typical range of collector temperatures used in space power applications. Coating the collector with such a material could potentially reduce the effective apir emissivity significantly. Phase 1 will: identify low emissivity materials which would be compatible with a converter environment; establish requirements to maintain low-emissivity surfaces by controlling emitter evaporation; and measure, in a vacuum, the radiant heat transfer in a thermionic convertor structure incorporating a low-emissivity collector surface. Estimates will be made of the impact on system performance in proposed system concepts. Phase 2, will address issues raised in fabrication and performance stability and will build and test a converter prototype.","agency":["Department of Defense","Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"MISSION MEDICAL","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A COMPACT HEAT EXCHANGER/REACTOR FOR ENDOTHERMIC FUELS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/288961","abstract":"AIRCRAFT DESIGNED FOR FLIGHT IN THE MACH 3-6 RANGE MUST INCORPORATE ACTIVE COOLING IN THE TURBORAMJET PROPULSION SYSTEM.

All of the evaluation criteria cited in the Solicitation point toward using a fan-in-fin tail rotor and developing approaches to eliminate the tail rotor drive train and hydraulic pitch actuation mechanism, Currently, a complex mechanical system delivers power to the tail rotor. In combat, it is a source of battle damage since the tail rotor is a single-point-failure item. Hydraulic variable pitch mechanisms are also a hazard since hydraulic-fluid leaks can ignite on hot engine surfaces, SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to investigate an all-electrically- actuated fan-in-fin tail rotor for the AH-IW. This will extend the fan-in-fin tail rotor concept by adding direct electric drive of the tail rotor via an electric motor and electrical actuation of the pitch mechanism via a magnetostrictive linear actuator, Electric drive eliminates the drive train while electric pitch actuation banishes hydraulics from the tail section.

To date, all efficient xenon fluoride lasers have their energy divided between 2 bands, 351 and 353 micrometer. One can increase the laser efficiency by heating the XeF to 425 degrees Kelvin, but this spreads the energy more evenly between the two bands. The 2-nm bandwidth is too large for coherent imaging techniques that DoD is trying to apply. By Raman shifting the 351 to the 353 band. Science Research Laboratory will collapse the bandwidth and make the coherence length the long enough for the most exacting imaging techniques while maintaining the high efficiency. Phase I will identify appropriate Raman media and Phase II will demonstrate the bandwidth collapse.

SURFACE STRESS LEVELS OF THIS MAGNITUDE WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF BEND STRENGTH, REDUCING FRACTURES RELATED TO THE AS-FABRICATED SURFACE DEFECT POPULATION. CERAMICS WITH HEEB-INDUCED, DEEP-LAYER (2-10 MM) COMPRESSIVE STRESSES WILL ALSO TOLERATE DEEPER SURFACE ABRASION DURING USE. THE STRENGTHENING PROCESS UTILIZES THE DEEP PENETRATION VOLUMETRIC HEATING ABILITY OF HIGH ENERGY ELECTRON BEAMS TO ESTABLISH A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT AT THE CERAMIC SURFACE. FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE STRUCTURAL CERAMICS WITH LOW CREEP RATES, THE GRADIENT MUST BE MAINTAINED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AT HIGH (1500-2200oC) TEMPERATURES. SCIENCES RESEARCH LABORATORY (SRL) HAS DEVELOPED A NEW GENERATION OF PULSED INDUCTION LINEAR ACCELERATORS WHICH ALLOW RELIABLE, COST EFFCIEINT PRODUCTION OF HIGH AVERAGE POWER ELECTRON BEAMS WITH THE NECESSARY PARAMETERS FOR CERAMIC SURFACE STRENGTHENING. A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THESE ACCELERATORS IS THE HIGH REPETITION RATE (>5000 PPS) ALL-SOLID-STATE PULSED POWER DRIVERS WHICH MAKE THESE ACCELERATORS SCALABLE TO MW POWER LEVELS AT AN ELECTRON BEAM COST OF LESS THAN $2/WATT. THE INDUCTION ACCELERATOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED BY SRL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE POWER DENSITIES (100-1000 W/CM2) AND BEAM ENERGIES (2-5 MEV) REQUIRED FOR CERAMIC STRENGTHENING.

Use of sparse elements will minimize the complexity, weight, and cost of the experiment, while the Hitchhiker approach will substantially reduce launch costs. Specifically, it is proposed to assess the feasiblity of being able to accurately emulate a Directed Energy Weapon spacecraft using a spatially correct satellite composed of sparse optical components. After orbital insertion, these components would be deployed out of the spacecraft to the correct relative distances. They would then represent a spacecraft-borne optical system that can be pointed and repointed to the required accuracy.

This material is for the insulator of the trilayer of a thermionic fuel element (TFE). This insulator must withstand rigorous conditions of long life at high temperature under exposure to nuclear radiation. Previous work has studied alumina, YAG, and diamond as possible RFE insulator materials. cBN is similar to diamond in many ways: high thermal conductivity, refractory, and large bandgap for high electrical resistivity. This material can potentially enable longer life in space nuclear reactors. Like diamond, cBN has been expensive to produce in bulk. However, recent experiments have shown that cBN can be readily deposited in thin film coatings. This is accomplished through a laser ablation deposition process. Laser deposition using long wavelength lasers (Nd: YAG operating in fundamental or second harmonics) have only produced BN films of hexagonal crystal structure. But laser deposition using excimer lasers operating in the UV show good promise. Work in the excimer laser deposition of boron nitride films on SI indicated that the resulting BN films of cubic zincblende structure. Regions of films also exhibit technique in cBN film preparation. BN films will be prepared by excimer laser deposition. The films will be characterized by scanning electron microscopy, raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction.

Thin-film boron phosphide isn't easy to grow; the Japanese have been trying for years. Spire thinks the answer is low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. Low pressure will keep gas molecules far enough apart to stop \"snow\" from forming but will still permit rapid crystal growth, important because 300 micron thick free-standing wafers are the program's goal.

What's more, by replacing hard-to-make aluminum-containing compounds with GaAs-Ge, Spire can make HBTs better and cheaper. Best of all, by choosing the right alloy, HBTs can be grown directly on GaAs wafers, then integrated with other electronic and optoelectronic devices.

In general, heat transfer in these devices improves as capillary sizes shrink, but they cannot be arbitrary reduced without eventually causing blockages and catastrophic hot spots. Instead, Spire proposes to keep the larger passages but micro-texture inner surfaces by ion beams to increase surface area, similar to using internal vanes. For really hot applications, this will also increase thermal emissivity, something ordinary capillaries cannot do. Feature sizes much smaller than optical wavelengths make micro-textured metals broadband light absorbers, nearly perfect blackbodies that radiate more effectively than plain metal surfaces. The extra radiational heat transfer could really make a difference.

This approach may provide improved capabilities for target detection and identification through examination of target resonance characteristics. Detection and processing of short duration, ultrawideband pulses that have random time intervals between pulses require new approaches to receiver design. Analog-to-digital conversion of ultrawideband signals for processing of resonance features is a major challenge for the development of this technology. TACAN Corporation proposes a new approach that converts single electromagnetic pulses into optical pulse trains that preserve the signal waveform for analog-to-digital conversion and facilitates signal processing. This approach uses a fiber-optic-coupled antenna and other fiber-optic components to build a circulating delay line and repeater, and allows analog-to-conversion for accurately recording the short duration return waveform. Applications include military sensors, remote inspection of structures, environmental sensing, and geophysical surveying.","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Tacan Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"RF DIODE LASER MODULATOR","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/325428","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Tacan Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"LARGE DYNAMIC RANGE, LINEAR RESPONSE LASER","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/325436","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Tacan Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"UNIQUE OPTICAL HIGH TEMPERATURE SENSORS FOR TURBINE ENGINES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/325444","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Tacan Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"THERMAL MANAGEMENT FOR HIGH-DENSITY ELECTRONICS USING EPITAXIAL LIFTOFF TECHNOLOGY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/325470","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Tacan Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"METHOD FOR DETECTING PINHOLES IN HERMETRIC COATINGS OF OPTICAL FIBERS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/325566","abstract":"DEMONSTRATE A FOURIER (LASER DIFFRACTION) INSPECTION METHOD FOR DETECTING PINHOLES IN HERMETIC COATINGS OF OPTICAL FIBERS.

Critical components, especially those containing highly reflective optical surfaces, may become obvious targets by reflecting light from laser designators or from sunlight. Applying appropriate coatings to the optical surfaces surpresses reflectivity by light scattering and absorption, but these applied coatings tend to interfere with the optical properties of the component. Takom will develop a technique using ion beam surface modification to produce ultralow reflectivity optical components without affecting essential optical properties of the parent material. With proper choice of exposure parameters, this process will generate a surface topology such that the material on the scale of the wavelength of light appears to have a smoothly changing mass density. Therefore, a smoothly graded refractive index through a surface layer will result in a significant reduction in reflectivity.","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Takom Company","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Bidirectional Modifiable Synaptic Element for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/326122","abstract":"To build fast inexpensive artificial neural network hardware, a high-performance but compact synapse circuit is required.

The plasma process will establish reactive moieties on the relatively inert crystallite basal plane of the graphite fiber. The wet-chemical treatment will covalently bond the resin matrix to the reactive plasma-generated moieties thus forming the interfacial covalent bond. The covalently bonded interfaces will improve interface-dependent mechanical properties by at least 50% and prevent degradation of these properties under hot-wet conditions. Prior work that established interfacial covalent bonds in OCF S-2 glass/polysulfone composites demonstrated that interface-dependent mechanical properties degraded by less than 8% during 106 degree C-9 RH aging conditions.

Polymeric protective coatings are ineffective in solid particle environments and are unable to withstand the high temperature environment of the T64 engine compressor. The broad damage area of compressor blades makes metallic protective coatings, such as have been developed for helicopter blades, unacceptable from a weight penalty. Conventional ceramic coatings have demonstrated excellent erosion resistance, but have been erratic in performance, difficult to apply to complex surfaces, and have poor adherence properties. A sol-gel derived ceramic coating offers tailorable porosity characteristics which should optimize erosion and toughness properties. The sol-gel process lends itself to applications to complex surfaces. A novel reactive primer will covalently bond the ceramic coating to the titanium substrate. Sol-gel processing studies will address tailorability of the alumina-silicate composition and microstructure. Pull-off tests will assess coating adherence achieved by the reactive primer.

Our performance modeling environment takes into account all of the aspects of automatic DAMA control, including; the constrints due to DAMA terminals and technical interface standard,s selection of observable statistics to measure, definition of system stochastic input paramters, and computer software that ties it all together. The proposed Phase I work includes analysis and simulation to quantify system performance under a variety of statellite configuration, terminal, operational, and traffic models. It also includes actual real-time simulation of candidate automatic DAMA control strategies that prove the value of the performance model. A successful Phase I feasibility program leads directly to a UHF on-the-air Phase Ii proof-of-concpet demonstration, including measurements to verify performance predicted in Phase I.

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE MACHINE PLANNING SYSTEMS HAVE LIMITED SUPPORT FOR VISUALIZATION FACILITIES TO SUPPORT SENSOR-BASED OPERATIONS, AND DONOT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF TASK PLANNING AUTOMATION.","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1992,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"INTELLIGENT ROBOT/SENSOR OPERATIONS PLANNING SYSTEMS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/123589","abstract":"A TELEROBOT-SENSOR PLANNING SYSTEM WILL BE DEVELOPED BY COMBINING MATURE VISION-BASED GUIDANCE TECHNOLOGY, STANDARDIZED ROBOTIC PLATFORM INTERFACES, AND AN INTERACTIVEROBOT PLANNING SYSTEM INTEGRATED INTO A GRAPHICAL ROBOTIC VISUALIZATION SYSTEM.

In the 21st Century, the battlefield environment will become so deadly that any exposure of personnel will have high lethality. Applying battlefield robotics will enhance personnel safety and will Aid force multiplication. However, \"man-in-the-loop\" control systems are a prerequisite in the unstructured battlefield environment. We Suggest standardized vehicle retrofit kits which incorporate manual override because many of the vehicle systems currently in use have automated counterparts which will still be used in manually operated modes. And finally, standardization and simplification of operator controls will be required since insertion of the technology should involve minimal training and specialization. In the proposed effort we will review current technology options and will produce a System Concept Document (SCD) describing the requirements and preliminary design for a family of standardized kit components for Marine vehicle teleremote retrofit. Because this effort is synergistic with a number of similar activities already underway, we expect to be able to prototype selected kit subsystems for a Phase I demonstration.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"APPLICATION OF ADAPTIVE AND MODEL-BASED DIAGNOSIS TECHNOLOGY TO SATELLITE SYSTEMS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/123935","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAPPING AND INSPECTION SYSTEM FOR INSIDE-TANK ROBOTICS APPLICATIONS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/123953","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1992,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A COMPACT ROBOTIC COMMAND CENTER PHASE II: IMPLEMENTING A HARDENED COMPACT UNIT","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/123965","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1992,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A COMPACT ROBOTIC COMMAND CENTER PHASE II: IMPLEMENTING A HARDENED COMPACT UNIT","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/123975","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1992,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null}]
