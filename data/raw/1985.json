CONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS BLEEDING UPON PROBING, SUPPURATION, OR GINGIVAL REDNESS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE DIAGNOSTICS WITH RESPECT TO THE DETECTION OF ACTIVE DISEASES. THE TEMPERATURE SENSING ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSED PROBE IS IMBEDDED IN THE PROBE TIP. THE TIP SHAPE AND SIZE ARE SIMILAR TO CONVENTIONAL PERIODONTAL PROBES WITH WILLIAMS MARKINGS. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A PROBE ARE (1) THE CONCURRENT MEASUREMENT OF SUCULAR TEMPERATURE AND ATTACHMENT LEVEL, (2) THE IDENTICAL PROBE INSERTION TECHNIQUE USED IN CONVENTIONAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL MEASUREMENT, AND (3) THE RAPIDITY IN ALLOWING FOR MULTIPLE-SITE EVALUATION OF DISEASE ACTIVITY. THE KEY FEATURE OF THIS PROBE WHICH ALLOWS THE FAITHFUL MEASUREMENT OF SULCULAR TEMPERATURE IS THE SPECIALLY DESIGNED LOW THERMAL MASS OF THE PROBE TIP. THIS FEATURE PROVIDES MINIMAL THERMAL PERTURBATION TO THE REGIONAL TISSUES THUS ALLOWING FOR A MEASUREMENT ACCURACY OF BETTER THAN 0.1 DEGREES C AND A RESPONSE TIME OF LESS THAN 2 SECONDS. THE PHASE I PROGRAM WHICH THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IS CONCENTRATED TOWARDS THE FABRICATION AND IN VITRO TESTING OF SUCH A PROBE FOR ITS REPRODUCIBILITY, SENSITIVITY, AND RESPONSE TIME. PRELIMINARY IN VIVO STUDY WILL BE PERFORMED TO RELATE TEMPERATURE TO PERIODONTAL DISEASE ACTIVITY. THE PHASE II PROGRAM WILL BE ORIENTED TOWARDS THE CLINICAL VALIDATION OF SULCULAR TEMPERATURE CHANGES ACCOMPANYING DISEASE ACTIVITY.

SINCE, 1973, NUMEROUS SYSTEMS STUDIES HAVE PRODUCED CONCEPTUAL FUSION REACTOR DESIGNS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN VIEWED AS MEETING THE NEEDS OF ELECTRIC UTILITIES. THESE STUDIES HAVE FEATURED SUPERCONDUCTING CONFINEMENT TOKAMAKS AND MIRRORS BECAUSE OF THE GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR PHYSICS BASIS AND THE CONVICTION THAT SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS OFFERED THE ONLY HOPE FOR AN ACCEPTABLE POWER BALANCE. HOWEVER, OTHER DESIGN EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED A VARIETY OF CONFINEMENT CONCEPTS BASED ON NORMALLY CONDUCTING MAGNETS. THESE STUDIES INDICATE THAT THIS MAGNET APPROACH CAN BE ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE PROVIDING THAT HIGH GAIN IS ACHIEVED, SUBJECT TO FIRST WALL HEAT FLUX CONSTRAINTS, AND THAT NEUTRON DOSE TO THE REACTOR INTERNALS IS RECOGNIZED AS A LIMIT. THE PROPOSED WORK IS ON A TOKAMAK CONCEPT THAT HAS BEEN CONCEIVED SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS. IT IS DIRECTED AT HIGH FIELD OPERATION TO COMPENSATE FOR MODEST BETA PERFORMANCE, HIGH GAIN, AND A REACTOR MAINTENANCE CONFIGURATION FOR THE CHANGEOUT OF NEUTRON DAMAGED CORES. CALLED THE DEMOUNTABLE TOKAMAK FUSION CORE (DTFC) CONCEPT, IT PROVIDES FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CENTER PORTION OF THE TOKAMAK, INCLUDING THE INNER TOROIDAL FIELD COIL ASSEMBLY, THE OH/PF COILS, AND THE FIRST WALL ASSEMBLY. THE OUTER TF COIL ASSEMBLY AND THE MAIN BLANKET ARE ONLY INFREQUENTLY REPLACED. THIS SCENARIO IS CONSISTANT WITH THE FACT THAT REACTOR INTERNALS ARE REPLACED WHEN A TARGET AMOUNT OF ENERGY HAS BEEN DELIVERED (AT A GIVEN NEUTRON DOSE).

THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENSION TO CELL WASHING OF A NEW CORE TECHNOLOGY OF BLOOD SEPARATE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED AT HEMASCIENCE LABORATORIES, SANTA ANA, CALIFORNIA. THE BASIS OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY IS A REVOLUTIONARY NEW TECHNIQUE TO EXPOSE A MEMBRANE FILTER TO A FLUID CONTAINING ELEMENTS TO BE FILTERED. EXTERNAL INERTIAL FORCES ARE USED TO PREVENT FORMED ELEMENTS IN THE BLOOD FROM ADHERING TO THE MEMBRANE. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW REDUCTION OF THE SURFACE AREA OF THE MEMBRANE FILTER FROM 10 TO 100 TIMES THAT USED IN CURRENT BLOOD FILTRATION SYSTEMS BASED ON FLAT PLATE AND HOLLOW FIBER TECHNOLOGIES AND THEREFORE PERMIT SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION. THE TECHNOLOGY IS CONTINUOUS AS OPPOSED TO THE BATCH OPERATION SO IT IS INHERENT FASTER THAN EXISTING DEVICES IN ITS PROCESSING TIME AND NO WASHED PRODUCT IS LOST.

THE L-2 CONTROLLER MUST BE THE CONTROLLER OF HIGHEST PRIORITY. SINCE ONLY ONE CONTROLLER MAY USE ACL, OTHER CONTROLLERS MUST USE REQUEST GRANT ARBITRATION. IN MANY APPLICATIONS IT IS UNDESIRABLE TO GIVE THE L-2 CONTROLLER HIGH PRIORITY. 2. ONLY ONE CONTROLLER ON THE ACB MAY USE ACL ARBITRATION.

WE HAVE RECENTLY CONDUCTED PRELIMINARYRESEARCH ON A NEW APPROACH, THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE. THIS TECHNIQUE USES A MICROCHAMBER WITH ELECTRODES TO CAUSE THE CELLS TO BE HELD BY PAIRS IN CONTACTTO EACH OTHER. AN ELECTRONIC IMPULSE IS THEN USED TO PUNCTURE THE MEMBRANE AT THE POINT OF CONTACT WHICH IMMEDIATELY INDUCES THE ONSET OF FUSION. THIS METHOD HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OVERCOME ALL OF THE LIMITATIONS MENTIONED ABOVE AND MAKE POSSIBLE THE SUCCESSFUL FUSION OF A WIDE VARIETY OF CELL PARTNERS NOT PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSABLE. THE RESULTING HYBRIDOMAS WILL BE OF USE IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING HLA TYPING, ANTITOXIN PRODUCTION AND BASIC RESEARCH. BIOFUSION, INC. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL PROPOSES TO DO THE RESEARCH NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A RELIABLE AND PRACTICAL ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION APPARATUS ALONG WITH A PROTOCOL SUITABLE FOR THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF CREATING A WIDE VARIETY OF HYBRIDOMAS. IN ADDITION, AS A SPECIFIC PRACTICAL TARGET, AS WELL AS A VEHICLE FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT, WE PROPOSE TO MAKE SPECIFIC HUMAN ANTIBODIES FOR HLA TYPING. IN PHASE I WE WILL FOCUS ON RESEARCH TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH THE POTENTIAL STRENGTHS AND THE PRESENT LIMITATIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE. IN PHASE II, WE WILL PERFECT THE TECHNIQUE AND STRIVE TO MAKE THE HUMAN HLA ANTIBODIES. THE POTENTIAL MARKET FOR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES IS EXTREMELY LARGE. THE ABILITY OF THE ELECTRONIC CELL FUSION TECHNIQUE TO FUSE VERYSMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY SHOULD ALLOW BIOFUSION, INC. TO PRODUCE A UNIQUE LINE OF PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF HLA TYPING AND ANTITOXINS. BY TEAMING WITH A LARGE COMPANY FOR PHASE III OF THE PROGRAM, THE RESULTS OF A SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL BE OF BOTHSCIENTIFIC AND COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1985,"firm":"Biofusion/rmd Jv","reseach institution":null},{"title":"PORTABLE RCBF SYSTEM FOR REAL TIME DIAGNOSTICS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/355373","abstract":"REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW (RCBF) IS AN IMPORTANT PARAMETER OF BRAIN FUNCTION IN ACUTELY AND CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS.
