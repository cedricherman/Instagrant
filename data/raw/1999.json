[{"title":"REGULATOR FOR IMPROVED RESPIRATORY PROTECTION WITH SCBAS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/799501","abstract":"The overall objective is to improve the safety and health of firefighters and rescue workers who use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in hazardous environment. The specific aim is to develop an electromechanical pressure regulator that assures positive pressure in the SBA facepiece even during strenuous activity. Positive pressure is essential to protect health and safety, because the facepiece pressure keeps out potentially poisonous gases from the environment. The proposed electromechanical pressure regulator overcomes the drawbacks of conventional, mechanical regulators. The three key innovations are: (1) a lightweight, piezoelectrically actuated, electromechanical valve, (2) an innovative electronic control and actuation system that consumes ver little power and (3) a power generating system driven by a trickle flow of compressed air that provides all the power required by the regulator. The rapid responses and wide control range of the electromechanical valve prevent over-breathing. The electronic control unit can warn the user of falling pressure in the mask. Phase I proved feasibility by fabricating a proof-of-concept regulator and testing it under extreme conditions using a SCBA facepiece and a breathing machine. In Phase II we will develop and demonstrate prototype regulators for commercial SCBAs which meet all relevant NIOSH and NFPA standards. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The primary applications is for a pressure-demand, positive-pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus worn by firefighters and hazardous materials workers. The device can be incorporated into new SCBA units and can also be retrofit to units already in the field. We estimate the potential market to be in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 per year. Create has teamed with one of the largest manufacturers of SCBAs to commercialize the electromechanical SCBA regulator.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"CREARE LLC ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Balloon Latitude Trajectory Control System","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/171553","abstract":"Global Aerospace Corporation is proposing to develop a totally new concept for latitude trajectory control system (TCS) for NASA\u2019s Ultra Long Duration (ULDB) Balloons. The advantages of the TCS concept are that it uses little power, operates at night, is lightweight, does not require detailed knowledge of the wind field, and allows the balloon to fly at a constant altitude. The TCS enables the balloon to avoid populous areas and hazards to payload recovery, reach desirable targets, steer around no-fly zones and select convenient landing sites. Currently, when a balloon deviates significantly from a desired flight path, cut down often occurs, sometimes before mission objectives have been met. With a TCS, fewer flights will be terminated early. Furthermore, it will be easier to obtain permission to launch since the planned flight path can be achieved in a greater range of conditions. No longer will balloons be at the mercy of the winds.

The resultant Unsteady unbalanced loads on the vertical tails can cause premature fatigue failure. A variety of methods for controlling the buffet problem have been proposed, but none have been definitively demonstrated as being an optimal solution. The proposed effort will utilize a state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary computing environment (MDICE) to evaluate the efficacy of a variety of proposed buffet-control methodologies and to design the optimum methodologies under a variety of flight conditions. MDICE will be configured with a computational fluid dynamics module (CFDFASTRAN), a structure dynamics module, and a conservative-consistent technique for fluid-structure interfacing. A controls module will be added when necessary to model certain active control methodologies. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the computational environment for prediction and control of twin-tail buffet. In this effort, the twin-tail buffet responses of a generic fighter aircraft will be computed and validated against the available experimental data.

Specific avenues for the proposed research are: (1) Current COIL nozzles typically inject a mixture of diluent gas and molecular iodine into the subsonic region of the O (sub 2) ((sup 1) increment) flow upstream of the nozzle throat. The resulting mixing leads non-uniform loading on the laser mirrors and to a non-uniform gain distribution ('sugar-scooping').

Unfortunately, adverse environmental conditions in shallow water scenarios can degrade the performance of active sonar. Improved performance is possible, however, if the sonar system can adapt to its environmental conditions. New transducer technologies that offer both spectral and spatial adaptability promise superior detection capabilities. This proposal considers the novel application of arrays of flextensional type actuators, sandwiched between cover plates. This innovative combination of flextensional drive elements and mass loading by cover plates permits low-frequency operation from an extremely compact unit. This work effort will make extensive use of state-of-the-art transducer models and extensive design expertise to determine efficacy of the proposed technology and provide a rapid virtual prototyping capability. Different types of flextensional geometry, multilayered configurations and hybrid mixed-frequency devices will be considered. Experimental prototype fabrication and characterization will be used to demonstrate the validity of the hybrid finite element modeling strategy. The proposed approach holds great promise for a new level of performance and adaptability in a cost effective, compact and efficient unit.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ADVANCED MAGNETICS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75778","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Parallel Neural Network Computational Tools for Aero-Structural System Analysis and Design","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75835","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ADVANCED MECHANICS TECHNOLOGY, LTD.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"BODY WORN WIRE FREE MICRO RECORDING SLEEP SENSORS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75961","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Method for Analyzing Poultry Specific Microchromosomes","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76173","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ADVANCED MICROBIAL SOLUTIONS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Computer Simulation Software for Drilling Operations Based on a New Rock/Bit Interaction Model","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76561","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"AAC International","reseach institution":null},{"title":"TARGETED DRUG DELIVERY TO THE BRAIN","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76581","abstract":"Not Available  Silicon carbide power electronics will figure into a variety of Air Force missions such as enabling the development of more electric aircraft and advancing the development of supersonic and hypersonic aerospace vehicles, which require advanced control electronics and sensors.

The key to the fidelity of any simulation is the quality of the underlying aerodynamic database, and while it is relatively straightforward to collect the initial data required for such a database, it is often the case that, during flight tests, the aircraft behaves different than predicted. In these situations, it is desirable to update the simulation data based on information gathered during actual flight tests.

These high pressure drops are largely due to high coolant velocities in the regen circuits caused by the use of low-aspect ratio coolant channels (4:1). In addition, low aspect ratio coolant lines cannot be tailored to optimize heat transfer throughout the regen circuit, this results in overcooling near the injector and nozzle exit. Adopting coolant channels with higher aspect ratios (15:1 instead of 4:1) would significantly reduce the pressure drop of the combustion chamber. However, in high aspect ratio channels, flow stratification causes heated coolant to stay near the hot gas wall, resulting in higher wall temperatures, reduced cycle life, and potential chamber failure. Flow stratification must be understood and eliminated if higher aspect ratio cooling channels are to become a practical technology. This effort will develop a theoretical model of flow stratification and a methodology for its mitigation in coolant channels by: 1) performing combined CFD/Heat Transfer analyses of channels with various aspect ratios to obtain an initial assessment of flow stratification, 2) anchoring the numerical results with experimental testing, and 3) developing technologies to mitigate the stratification of the coolant in the channels.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Advanced Micro-Pixelized Scintillator for Structural Biology","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/83812","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"LOW POWER, HIGH SENSITIVITY, ELEC OLFACTORY SENSORS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/83822","abstract":"Not Available  Composite materials offer significant benefits for the next generation of lithography tools, including dramatic improvements in weight, vibrational stability, and thermal stability.

The overall goal of this program is to develop such a tool by combining state-of-the-art analysis methods with an extensive test database in order to generate certifiable strength and fatigue life predictions of rotorcraft joint configurations and loading conditions. For Phase I and Phase I Option, NSE Composites Stress Services (NSE) is teamed with members of the rotorcraft industry (Bell, Boeing Helicopter, and Sikorsky) to identify candidate joints that have potentially high payoff as bonded joint redesigns.

CSA Engineering proposes to develop a hybrid passive-active noise suppression system for the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle. This hybrid system, combining passive and active elements and inherent to the vehicle, will provide global noise reduction inside the vehicle cabin, making protective headsets unnecessary and facilitating verbal communication. Once the system requirements and constraints have been established, the suitability of a number of passive and active acoustic suppression techniques will be assessed. The best performing passive and active techniques will be combined in a preliminary design. A structural-acoustic simulation of the vehicle response including the disturbance sources will be used to evaluate performance levels of the noise suppression design.

The MARCAS provides both high vertical and high horizontal resolution over a wide aperture to provide AAAVs' drivers with WideViewTM detection without any moving parts. WideViewTM is important because drivers must make navigation decisions not only based on forward obstacles but also on potential obstacles on either side (similar to changing lanes on a highway). Thanks to the high vertical angular resolution and because of shallow water operation, the MARCAS will discern direct-paths from multipaths (reverberation) and differentiate obstacles above and below the 20-foot  safety-depth . Finally, the MARCAS is stealthy because it uses GORCA Technologies' proprietary concept, BiopulseTM, which is coded copies of naturally occurring biological transient pulses such as shrimp sounds.

Propagation over a long path causes the atmospheric induced phase errors to be converted into amplitude errors, which we refer to as scintillation. A potential solution to the problem of target tracking under conditions of strong scintillation is to use phase unwrapping techniques to reconstruct an estimate of the phase of the incident field which accounts for the discontinuities arising from branch points. Recent work in two-dimensional phase unwrapping techniques has shown that if the aperture is appropriately sampled by a Hartmann sensor, then it is possible to reconstruct the actual phase of the incident field.

The guidance system usually consists of a moderate field of view (FOV), moderate resolution optical system. The fusing system usually covers a significantly larger FOV at coarser resolution. A  hand-off' or cueing from guidance to fusing is required. In addition, while some research has been implemented toward utilizing domes with aerodynamic shapes, little implementation has taken place. OPTICS 1 proposes the use of a single zoom optical system for both guidance and fusing, eliminating the need for multiple optical systems and saving system cost and complexity. Such an optical system, if used with newly developed  foveal vision  focal plane arrays (FPAs) and on-chip signal processing, can likely perform all of the functions of the currently implemented systems. This technology, combined with aerodynamic dome shapes will allow operation over the existing flight envelopes of today's missiles with a single optical system.

It is used to detect the position and intensity of the dangerous light source. The sensed photo-voltage is used to directly control the opacity of the selected part of the pixels in the liquid crystal filter. The opacity of the specifically chosen pixels will reduce the intensity of the light originating from the corresponding dangerous source.

Intelligent sensors combine detection, processing, and control functions onto a single package to allow for autonomous detection and interpretation of optical signals. A specific case where an intelligent optical system is needed is in the detection, processing, and evaluation of infrared polarization imagery, which has shown potential for improved target discrimination over other infrared imaging techniques. To meet this need we propose to develop an intelligent, compact, imaging infrared polarimeter on a chip. The key innovation on which this polarimeter will be based is the recent development of efficient lithographic antennas at mid and far-infrared wavelengths. These antennas can be integrated monolithically with a detector on the same substrate, and since the shape of an antenna determines its response to incident ramification, an antenna and detector combination can be made polarization selective. By fabricating the proper set of antenna shapes with their attached detectors onto a single substrate, a  superpixel,  which is capable of measuring the full Stokes vector can be developed. Reductions in size, cost, complexity, and improvement in speed over current systems are possible with a solid state polarimeter.","agency":["Environmental Protection Agency"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Burnett Engineering, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"COLLOID THRUSTERS FOR MICRO AND NANOSATELLITES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/115064","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Busek Co., Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Design of a 10 MW, 91 GHz Gyroklystron for Linear Accelerators","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/115710","abstract":"Not Available  Carlow International Incorporated (Carlow) and AST Engineering Services, Inc. are pleased to submit this SBIR Phase I proposal to the Naval Sea Systems Command to develop modeling and simulation (M&S) technology to assess reduced manning impacts on ship crew operational effectiveness and computer resources.

(2) an vector search algorithmic breakthrough, the TNE, discovered by FTI in 1994. This very low complexity algorithm can be used to search the database using partially corrupted or masked vectors, which is key to recovering the noise-suppressed speech signal.

The results of Phase I studies indicated that intraspecific variation for IHNV resistance exists in rainbow trout and steelhead. The results of molecular genetic studies indicated that sufficient genetic variation exists both within and between the two strains of Oncorhynchus mykiss to allow for identification of genetic markers associated with IHN resistance which would significantly reduce the time required to develop IHN resistant strains.\n\nThe Phase II research will determine the linkage of molecular markers to quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to IHN.

Apectral imagery has the greatest potential to provide accurate data to the operators in an Automatic Target Recognition environment due to the ability to determine minute spectral differences between targets. Nonetheless, spectral based technology has not been widely accepted or utilized in the operational community. This is primarily due to system limitations in the literal image detection ranges, user experience, sensor limitations, availability of tactical sensor data, and validated exploitation tools and methods. It is the goal of this Phase I to determine a methodolgy and process to identify and evaluate (qualitatively and quantitatively) technological advances in the multi-to ultra-spectral exploitation arena.

A novel approach for a bi-stable MEMS based latching microswitch is proposed permitting the latching microrelay to be fabricated as an integral part of the microsatellite system bus architecture. This new approach will enable the bus architecture to be reconfigured in the event of hardware failures or to switch in back-up systems. The presence of many DC capable microswitches will also enable a higher degree of flexibility to be built into the multifunctional structure.

The variability of the seabed properties far exceeds those experienced in water column, making the shallow water environmental assessment much more complex. Here, we propose to develop a new model-based approach based on identification of distinct time-angle properties of seabed reverberation which are hypothesized to uniquely characterize the seabed sound speed structure and the reverberation mechanism such as volume and surface scattering. Image processing techniques such as edge detection and template matching are used to detect the seabed characterizing features of the time-angle signal power.

Such antennas can aid a number of missions in a cost-effective manner, including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Foliage Penetration (FOPEN), Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTI) and Counter-Camouflage Concealment and Deception (CC&D). UAVs have been shown to be a cost-effective method of carrying out these missions, but without the right antennas, these missions may fall short of their goals. The antennas required for these missions must be effective over a broad bandwidth, and they can induce only minimal drag on the surface of the aircraft. The frequencies of interest extend as low as 25 MHz. It is at the low end of the band where size constraints are most challenging. Obtaining a good antenna pattern is a challenge unless the antenna is the same size as a wavelength. Impedance matching over a broad bandwidth is also a challenge, because electrically small antennas normally have a matching circuit that provides a good match only within a very narrow band. Another challenge lies in steering the beam electronically. To address these challenges, we propose developing a crossed linear dipole array along the bottom of the fuselage and wing that is flush with the aircraft surface. We will explore antennas that reach as low as 25 MHz, with a decade of bandwidth. Designs that introduce minimal drag will be considered. We will calculate the antenna pattern, and we will calculate impedance match and radiation efficiency. We will also consider how to design systems with two polarizations. Finally, we will explore the patterns available after steering the beam using phase shifters.

Increasingly, there is a demand for large, easily deployed, temporary shelters for many aspects of military activities. Current shelters are generally not well insulated resulting in large heating and cooling environmental controls units (ECU's). These ECU's have large power requirements and are bulky and heavy reducing mobility and consequently the effectiveness of mobile military units. The poor insulation results in an increased thermal signature leaving the shelters vulnerable to detection and targeting. Further, the limited insulation results in internal thermal gradients within the structure and condensation further eroding the concept's usefulness. L'Garde proposes solutions to these insulation problems through a technology commonly used in space programs, multi-layer insulation (MLI). Incorporating multi-layer insulation into temporary structures will greatly enhance environmental thermal control while concurrently addressing the thermal signature reduction. L'Garde, with 27 years of experience in inflatable space structures, RV decoys and targets with prerequisite signatures over multiple spectral bands, is well qualified to conduct this effort.

Under this Phase I effort, ASIT will concentrate on developing innovative spectral processing technologies and prototype demonstration of automated chemical detection and identification techniques that address real-world problems including: time varying spectral mixtures, with unknown background composition, and unknown interferant signatures.  BENEFITS:  To address both Government and commercial needs for passive, stand-off chemical detection and identification, this effort will combine existing FTIR sensors with specialized analysis software and lead to the development of a portable and fully automated chemical analysis system.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"CORETEK, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/133684","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"CORIXA CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"VACCINE: AUTO-IMMUNE DESTRUCTION OF TRANSPLANTED ISLETS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/133692","abstract":"Not Available  The goals of this program are to design, fabricate and test a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) specifically designed for use with Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector (QWIP) arrays and to incorporate the advanced signal processing requirements needed for Third Generation FLIRs.

The ability to reliably perform tasks according to a schedule is a key to independent living, e.g., taking correct medications on time, and for maintaining employment, e.g. getting to work on time or knowing when to move on to the next task. People with mental retardation are often quite limited in time management skills. The proposed research will demonstrate the application of a portable device designed to increase independence and self-determination in time management for individuals with mental retardation. The long-term objective is to develop Schedule Assistant, a pocket-sized Windows CE based software system for providing automated schedule management support. The Schedule Assistant system will generate automated onscreen visual prompts using color pictures in combination with audio prompts using digitally recorded verbal messages in response to a time-based schedule of events to help the user maintain a schedule and perform time-sensitive vocational tasks. The research focus is on building and field testing a Schedule Assistant prototype to assess its effectiveness for improving independence in meeting time requirements in scheduled tasks, and reducing supervision requirements for individuals with mental retardation.

Each power-amplifier (PA) module must amplify multiple carriers simultaneously. The resultant high peak-to-average ratio causes conventional PAs to be very inefficient (5-10 percent). Kahn-technique (EER) transmitters combine nonlinear RF amplifiers with a high-level modulator to implement a high-efficiency linear transmitter. Such transmitters have recently been demonstrated from HF (250 W) through L band. Their average efficiency for multiracial signals is typically several times that of a conventional linear amplifier (e.g., 50-60 percent). Unfortunately, existing modulator designs limit the bandwidth to 50 to 100 kHz. This program will investigate techniques for wideband high-efficiency amplification. The preferred technique uses a high-level modulator that combines a class-S modulator with a class-B amplifier. The class-S modulator amplifies the low-frequency components of the envelope (which constitute most of the power). The class-B amplifier adds the high-frequency components. The result is a transmitter which is nearly as efficient as a Kahn-technique transmitter, but can operate with bandwidths suitable for satcom and other multicarrier applications.

Reliable manufacturing of advanced SOI-based products requires accurate characterization tools. Presently, the semiconductor industry lacks the necessary instrumentation to non-destructively characterize and qualify SOI wafers with silicon layers thicker than several microns. To meet the demand, a joint venture of On-Line Technologies Inc. and ADE Corporation will develop a combined thick-film SOI characterization tool employing FTIR reflectometry and multi-laser light scatterometry. The system will be able to 1) measure thicknesses of the top silicon and the buried oxide (BOX) layers, resistively and macro-defect concentration in the silicon layer, density of the BOX layer, 2) evaluate the integrity of the interface bond between the silicon film and the BOX layer, and 3) detect defects generated by the wafer treatment. Three innovations will be combined in this project to render infrared practical for SOI characterization: 1) A breakthrough optical system from On-Line Technologies, eliminating spectral artifacts arising from the wafer backside reflections, and providing significantly higher accuracy than conventional FTIR. 2) Multi-layer model-based analysis software providing a flexible way to deduce unknown parameters of interest from the reflectance spectra. 3) Multi-spectral (visible and near-IR) laser scatterometry capable of probing both surface and buried interface quality.

In particular, we will study: 1) QoS needs and requirements for DoD's tactical applications, 2) previously proposed and implemented schemes to support QoS in both fixed and wireless networks, 3) incorporation of QoS parameters into ad-hoc networks, 4) effective link-sensing techniques for QoS-based routing, and 5) how Alternate Path Routing can be employed within ad-hoc networks.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Energia, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/157486","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"EERGC CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/157488","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Environmental Protection Agency"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"EERGC CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/157685","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Non-Volatile Thin-film Semiconductor Mass Memory","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/157687","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"STTR Phase I: Enhanced Cooling Using a Fluid Containing Magnetic Nanoparticles","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/157756","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Energy Intl Inc","reseach institution":"University of Washington"},{"title":"Heat Switch for Microspacecraft Thermal Control","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/158075","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Energy Science Laboratories, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Composite Ion Thruster","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/158077","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Energy Science Laboratories, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Lightweight Thruster for Laser-Assisted Propulsion","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/158080","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Energy Science Laboratories, Inc.","reseach institution":"Renselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"title":"CLEAN AND EFFICIENT UTILIZATION FROM AGRICULTURAL RESIDUES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/158227","abstract":"Not Available Phase I research proved the feasibility of EnerTech's Slurry Carbonization technology for economically producing clean and marketable fuels from high-moisture agricultural residues and wastes, especially animal manures.

Immersive HMDs also have valuable commercial applications in education, architecture, medicine, entertainment, virtual prototyping, teleconferencing, scientific and financial data visualization and web-based experiences. All of the previously existing motion-tracking technologies (magnetic, acoustic, optical, mechanical, gravimetric) have significant problems with jitter, latency, interference, line-of-sight, accuracy, and/or range. These deficiencies lead to simulator sickness which can erase all the benefits of the immersive application. In addition to HMDs, many other applications (i.e. weapon aiming, camera tracking, personal navigation, etc.), require improved tracking technology as well. InterSense has patented, developed, and successfully commercialized the world's first inertial and sensor-fusion-based motion tracking systems.

NASWT requirements for enhanced accuracy, longer range, and higher delivered energy on target demand higher energy, higher temperature propellants and new projectile designs. These requirements accelerate gun barrel and missile launch tube wear and, in some cases, preclude the implementation of new propellants or projectiles. Alternatives have been proposed to inhibit wear. Potentially the simplest, most cost-effective such alternative is the addition of wear- and corrosion-resistant refractory metal bore surface treatments to existing barrels and tubes. The success of this approach has been limited to date due to high barrel length-to-diameter (L/D) ratios and related limitations of current processes for fabricating refractory metal liners within high L/D bores. These limitations are especially great for rifled barrels. To overcome these limitations, Ultramet proposes to use an innovative new low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to apply refractory metals directly within conventional gun steel barrels without degrading or distorting the steel jacket. In Phase I, specific applications and goals will be identified and the feasibility of fabricating net-shape refractory metal bore surface treatments will be demonstrated.

Hot section components can be tested for defects such as blocked cooling holes and passages, incompletely drilled holes, delamination of bonded components and thermal barrier coating bond integrity in a more effective manner using level 1 operators at tremendous cost savings. By comparing each component to a standard that has been previously determined to be acceptable/good, discrepancies can be identified and all test results compared and archived.

This project will attempt to overcome the saturation limit by investigating changes in geometry, cathode material, anode potential, and/or magnetic field of the Penning gauge tube. Once an effective combination of changes is determined, a commercially feasible device will be developed and tested.

However, the only source of dense enough coatings is a physical vapor deposition process that is slow and costly. The cathodic (vacuum) arc would be a candidate coating technology that is capable of high deposition rates at a lower cost. Unfortunately, its application to boron-based coatings is limited due to poor electrical conductivity and thermal stress tolerance of boron-based cathodes. This project will use properly sintered cathodes and in situ heating of the cathode in order to overcome not only the poor conductivity but also the thermal stress problem. In Phase I, it was shown that while hot-pressed or simply-pressed boron and poron/carbon cathodes collapse under the thermal stress of the arc, specially sintered boron carbide cathodes resisted thermal stress. This result was verified independently in both a continuous arc and a pulsed arc. In Phase II, advanced technology will be applied to a specially sintered cathode for continuous, uniform heating. A sintered material with a higher boron-to-carbon ratio will be produced (up to almost pure B), since the coatings obtained during Phase I were too carbon-rich. Improved substrate heating and biasing will be pursued to further encourage the desired crystal growth with dual boron and carbon sources. Commercia!

The only signals transmitted are single pulses which can be generated by a single transistor which is either on or off. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the several gigahertz range. UWB is able to penetrate foliage because of its low frequency components, which allows pulses to easily pass through foliage, or even walls, tree trunks, and concrete. In the system we propose, these pulses are generated in a pseudo-random sequence, making them virtually impossible to detect, and very difficult to jam. The energy from each pulse may be far below the noise level and is only detectable if you know exactly when to listen for the pulse, and can average many pulses together.

The product of the investigation will be a proposed integrated diagnostic system based on embedded load measurement for a variety of CBM and other load monitoring applications. The development will focus on achieving small element size for minimum intrusion, cost effective integration with mechanical components, and will incorporate integrated processing capability. There are several reasons that acquisition of mechanical load for condition assessment is considered advantageous by comparison to more conventional CBM approaches based on acceleration (vibration) for example. Load monitoring can be employed to assess or predict a component's life expectancy whereas vibration monitoring detects imminent failure. This implies that mechanical load based CBM offers an advantage where advanced planning of maintenance is crucial. Moreover, access to real-time mechanical load data may be useful for other purposes such as overload avoidance or optimization of operating conditions. In summary, the availability of low-cost embedded load measurement and processing will enable predictive maintenance, characterization and optimization of operational conditions, overload detection and avoidance, and fatigue monitoring.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Inflexxion, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SELF ADVOCACY AND EMPOWERMENT FOR CANCER PATIENTS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/190468","abstract":"Not Available  Identification by radar of moving targets, including aircraft, ground vehicles, and ships, is difficult because their complex backscattering behavior is coupled with motion that is not smooth.

Current polarization filters are largely limited to operation at visible wavelengths, and those for infrared wavelengths are based on wiregrids and are unsuitable for real-time polarimetric imaging. The proposed tunable infrared polarization filter is based on Tunable Refractive Birefringent Optic technology, integrating a microwedge array with liquid crystal. The compact, low-voltage liquid crystal tunable polarization filter (LCTPF) to be used in this device is superior to others in that it is highly efficient and has a high extinction ratio, wide wavelength coverage, a large aperture, and a large acceptance angle. The LCTPF itself is commercially attractive because it will be producible at low cost using mature fabrication techniques and commercial materials. In Phase I, we will design and analyze the performance of the LCTPF, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept device at near infrared wavelengths.  BENEFITS:  This project will lead to low-cost, high performance, large aperture tunable IR polarization filter technology that can be applied to many IR imaging systems.

The Nitinol wires will be plastically strained during inflation changing their resistance which will be measured by a portable data acquisition system based on Mide's portable data logger. Since the Nitinol wires can strain as much as 8% in the Martensitic phase, the measurement system will be impedance matched with the rigging lines and it will be able to withstand the high shock loads experienced by the parachute during inflation. The wires are also thin and bending them to small radii will allow normal packaging of the parachute. The system can be used over and over by restraining the wires through electrical heating. The Nitinol measurement system will provide the Army with an accurate cost effective, robust measurement system. In Phase I Mide will design the measurement system and validate it using bench-level and a 1/4-scale prototype. The initial the tests will be done under controlled laboratory conditions.

First, these two complementary approaches will be combined to solve the firing problem at the gun mount and turret interface location. Second, the combined approach will be applied to the gun barrel to reduce its undesired vibratory motions excited by external and internal disturbances, such as gun firing frequency. Conceivably, the proposed SIMAG approach could be designed to first passively reconfigure the distribution and propagation of excess vibrational energy (i.e., intentional confinement); and therefore, confine vibrations to certain non-critical regions within a structure. Concentrated passive, active, or smart damping elements or cancellation techniques will be applied to more effectively dissipate or cancel the trapped vibrations and to prevent an energy build up in the assembly. Such combinations will result in a significant reduction in fluctuating loads and deformations.

Specifically, the goal is to commercialize a microwave SiC heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) with useful gain up to 20 GHz for satellite base stations, high-power transmitters and wireless communications. The advantages of HBTs over FETs are their expected superior linearity and current handling capability. A novel method of forming the 4H-SiC/6H-SiC heterojunciton will be pursued to form the base-emitter junction of an all SiC HBT. This method is expected to yield a high quality heterojunction suitable for minority carrier injection while avoiding the lattice mismatch and induced stress of a GaN/SiC junction. A novel self-aligned structure compatible with the 4H-SiC/6H-Sic material system is also proposed resulting in minimal parasitic elements and superior microwave performance.

CTI proposes to enhance the active imaging capability in the 1.5 to 4 -um region by utilizing a nonlinear optical (NLO) converter which provides frequency shifting to shorter wavelengths where cheaper, faster, lower noise, and room-temperature detectors exist. In addition, it provides optical gain, spectral filtering, controlled field-of-view, and superior rejection of background radiation. This results in an increase in performance to nearly the shot-noise limit without sacrificing ranging capability. Modern NLO materials can operate with high efficiency using modest pump sources in a compact design. The enhanced receiver capability reduces the pump power constraints resulting in a more compact overall system. Advanced sensor functionality including range-gating can be performed optically by modulating the pump source. In Phase I, CTI will conduct detailed analyses and laboratory demonstrations to validate the proposed concept.

More specifically, it is now known that the Shikimate Pathway, an enzymatic pathway that provides essential aromatics, is vital to the survival of P. falciparum. By blocking any of the seven enzymes in this pathway, it is possible to attenuate growth of the organism. Since these enzymes are not present in humans, their blockage presents an opportunity to effectively and selectively treat the disease without harm to human cells.  We propose to clone the recently discovered P. falciparum charismata synthase (enzyme #7 of the Shikimate pathway) in E. Coli, by known procedures. Using the resulting product, we will then develop a prototype high throughput assay, which will lead to the development (in Phase II) of a major screening program of combinatorial libraries of potential antimalarial drugs.

Unless test procedures and acceptance/rejection criteria for space qualification of PEMs are developed, hermetically sealed microcircuits will still be required even though they are very expensive and/or very limited in availability.

Information security research efforts have concentrated on devising host, network or system level defensive mechanisms that can either prevent, or detect and eliminate such attacks so that system impacts are minimized.  However, a decision tool that considers the cost and performance degradations of defensive mechanisms, and that recognizes resource constraints of both parties, should assist deployment of defensive strategies.  Moreover, an effective representation of the defense situation in the face of ongoing and potential assaults and deployed countermeasures will help the security manager to identify the need for improvement of system security.  We propose to develop a game theory based software tool that provides an effective representation of the current and expected nature of future security situation of an enterprise system.

Solid regenerator cartridges with microchannel structure (MCS) made of magnetic lanthanide-rich materials (e.g. Er(sub 3)Ni) are suggested instead of traditional regenerator beds packed with spheres. A regenerator cartridge with a microchannel structure offers the best design for cryocoolers because it has the highest ratio of heat transfer area to pressure drop. Its effectiveness is 20 to 25% higher than that of regenerator beds packed with spheres. Lack of technology for fabricating regenerators with microchannel structures from brittle magnetic intermetallics have prevented their use in the past. This project deals with a novel patented fabrication technique for making multichannel regenerators from brittle intermetallic compound Er(Sub 3)Ni, which exhibits sharp rise in heat capacity at temperatures slightly below 10K. The fabrication technique includes the co-extrusion of fine Er(sub 3)Ni powders together with a polymer binder and filler. It offers a possibility to fabricate cryocooler regenerator cartridges from brittle magnetic intermetallics with a controlled surface area and a low fluid flow resistance. The mechanical stability of MCS regenerators is expected to be much better than that of the beds packed with spherical particles.

This information can be used to study prototype engine components as well as to monitor the health of operating machinery. During Phase I we will analyze several opto-mechanical designs, select the most appropriate, construct a breadboard, and demonstrate ultra-fast profilometry measurements. Careful attention is placed on developing a robust system that can operate under the harsh thermal and vibratory conditions of an operating turbine. We will work closely with engineers at a leading engine manufacture to develop a prototype design commensurate with the industry's measurements needs and compatible with existing engine access constraints.

We present a framework within which interoperability can be achieved when a sound approach to applying HLA to the integration of disparate simulation systems is followed. This solution is based on a federation engineering approach employing the FEDEP across the diverse set of naval flight training systems.

(PSI), along with its development partner ITT Systems and Sciences Inc. (ITT) , proposes to develop an innovative compact and high power infrared LIDAR system for the standoff detection and discrimination of biological aerosols at ranges approaching 10 km.  Our approach anticipates the use of the signal (~l.55 um) and idler (~3.45 pm) wavelengths from a solid state optical parametric oscillator (OPO) transmitter to provide a ratio of returns which is unique to biological aerosols and clearly differentiable from normal aerosol backgrounds, thereby performing the discrimination task.  This approach may be extended through the use of wavelength tuning in the signal channel to detect the chemical signature of growth media which are co-distributed in the agent containing aerosol.  The key innovation in the development of the LIDAR is in the configuration of the OPO cavity, which resonates on the idler and only extracts the signal on the last pass through the cavity.  Consequently, the output of the device tends to follow the beam quality of the pump device -providing low divergence with good beam profile which enhances conversion efficiency.  The effort also addresses key uncertainties in the magnitudes of aerosol backscatter coefficients which are key to bio-agent discrimination.

Unlike other conventional methods which first separate soot from the exhaust gas and then burn it by raising the temperature of the trapped soot, the proposed method uses properties of non-thermal plasma to generate free radicals to oxidize the soot directly in the exhaust gas. The potential of the approach for soot oxidation presented here stems from the fact that free radicals react with diesel particulates (soot) in a way normally associated with a very high temperature, much higher than the actual ignition temperature for these particulates. The free radicals will be generated in the exhaust gas containing soot. The proposed device will cause a minimal, if any, pressure drop in the exhaust stream; moreover, its only energy requirement is the relatively low average power supply to its magnetron.

The PDPA allows logic and routing resources to be programmed in groups having a size equal to the bus width, reducing the number of programming bits needed to implement user functions. This specialization also reduces the routing to logic ratio permitting more computational logic resources.

Within the last few years low cost ultra-high precision oscillators have become available, and these now make it possible to build TM-UWB radar and communication systems which have no baseband frequency. The only signals transmitted are single pulses which can be generated by a single transistor which is either on or off. Impulses in the time domain generate very wide bandwidth signals in the frequency domain, and the signals generated by our current hardware have bandwidths in the gigahertz range. Since the transmission effectively happens over gigahertz bandwidth, this type of radar and radio is virtually impossible to detect and infeasible to jam. TM-UWB radio requires no frequency allocation since energy is effectively transmitted on a wide band of frequencies simultaneously. Likewise, as long as users use a different pseudo-random pulse timing, there will be no interference between users, and there is no problem with multipath transmission. Gigahertz transmission rates are achievable.

This information could include warning or status reports, technical specifications and instructions, geographical maps with individual perimeter or safe lane markings, telemetry from remote sensors, or any other information that could be transmitted over a conventional wired or radio network. Combat security is maintained because only friendly users will have the key necessary to decrypt the transmitted information.  BENEFITS:  Commercial products will be the light transmission and the Combat Data Device.  In addition to military uses, there will be uses for hearing handicapped users, paging in buildings, museums, hospitals and other such areas.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Research & Diagnostic Antibodies","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Automated Performance Assessment Tools","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/292030","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Research Development Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"MURINE SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/292064","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Research Genetics, Inc.","reseach institution":"Missing"},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/292094","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Research International, Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Implicit Unstructured Adaptive Mesh ALE Navier-Stokes Solver for Hypersonic Vehicle Simulation","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/292197","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Research South, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Zenith Viewing Spectroradiometer for O3, SO2, NO2, Aerosol Optical Depths and UltraViolet Spectral Radiances (7008-490)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/292243","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"RESEARCH SUPPORT INSTRUMENTS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Self-Calibrating Multi-Mode Filter Spectroradiometer with Measurement Applications for Column Amounts of O3, NO2, SO2 and Aerosol Optical Depths","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/292251","abstract":"Not Available  ARGTEC is pioneering the use of a new, innovative technology based on the theory of Attributed Relational Graph for content-based indexing and retrieval in large information databases. We have achieved several breakthroughs in the development of this technology. We applied this approach to indexing and retrieval in Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) with a remarkable success. When tested on large fingerprint databases provided by the FBI and the British Home Office, it delivered > 99% identification accuracy (i.e., < 1% Type I error) and close to zero false alarm rate. In benchmarks conducted by the customer, it achieved better than one order-of-magnitude reduction in the rate of false alarms in comparison with other competing state-of-the-art approaches, especially when presented with partial information, e.g., poor quality latent fingerprints collected from crime scenes or similar uncontrolled environments. ARGTEC proposes to develop and implement a generalized content-based indexing and retrieval system for global information databases. We will expand the ARG technology used successfully in AFIS to a hierarchical ARG scheme capable of processing more generalized global information that contains textual and non-alphanumeric information at multiple levels of detail and resolution. We will show that the hierarchical ARG representation scheme, coupled with our suites of matching algorithms are especially effective in handling noisy and partial information. ARGTEC is working with several industrial partners in both defense and commercial arenas.

To extend this technology to proximity fuses in small to medium caliber munitions and sub-munitions, it is now necessary to develop novel techniques for lower power consumption and further miniaturization by expansion of scale of integration combining RF and signal processing circuits. This proposal describes Hittite's approach to develop a highly integrated chip for the low-power ultra-miniature proximity fuses. The proposed approach is based on Hittite's unique circuit techniques and newly emerging silicon and gallium-arsenide semiconductor processes. The new processes allow operation of silicon MMICs at higher frequencies and integration of signal processing circuits in GaAs, showing a promise of highly integrated multi-function mixed-signal ICs. The proposed program will lead to definition of optimum scale of integration, selection of the optimum process, and demonstration of the feasibility of the low-power ultra-miniature fuses.

Recently, p-i-n photodiodes using InAs/InGaSb type-II QWs have achieved detectivities larger than 1 x 10 10 cmHz 1/2/W at 8.8 um and 78 K, with a peak detectivities of 2.1 x 10 10 cmHz 1/2/W at 6 um. We have studied InAs/InGaSb type-II QW photoconductors. With improved MBE growth technology, we have improved the responsivity of type-II photoconductors by a factor 50, due to the improved interface quality and material quality, and hence the better optical properties and longer carrier lifetime. Currently, we have demonstrated among the best performance of photoconductors using III-V materials up to 14 um. In the program, we will develop large two-dimensional arrays of IR photodetectors based on InAs/InGaSb type-II QWs at 8 to 20 um.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Digital Visions, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Technologies to Produce ENSDF-traceable Libraries for Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300099","abstract":"Not Available  Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) offer significant military and commercial cost savings to the turbine industry. However, the benefits have not been realized yet, largely because of inadequate reliability and low thermal cycles to failure. The biggest problem lies with oxidation of the metallic bond-coat. UES proposes to use a patented filtered cathodic arc deposition system to produce a novel TBC system of high performance. The proposed approach involves depositing a 5 um MCrAlY layer on the superalloy substrate, followed by deposition of a high quality Y-doped alumina coating of 0.5 - 1 um thickness. Processing parameters will be controlled to obtain primarily alpha-alumina, whose main purpose is to drastically reduce oxidation of the underlying metal. The alumina will be coated with yttria stabilized zirconia using the electron beam physical vapor deposition method. In Phase I, we shall concentrate on obtaining a durable alumina layer, that also retards oxide scale formation of the underlying metal. Oxidation tests will be performed to measure its response to isothermal and cyclic exposures. Successful evidence of these capabilities will provide justification for a Phase II effort. The program involves teaming with Chromalloy, a major TBC manufacturer, who would like to install UES's equipment on successful demonstration of the program.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Digital Visions, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"LONG, FLEXIBLE MULTICHANNEL NEURAL MICROELECTRODES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300306","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Monitoring, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300744","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Solutions, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Large Mosaic Liquid Crystal Fabry-Perot Etalon for Atomospheric Sensing","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300758","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Solutions, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Solid-State, Ultra-high Resolution Filters for Wind Measurements (SSURF-Wind)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300760","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Solutions, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300986","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Systems Company Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Automated On-line Health Monitoring","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/301037","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Systems Company Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A nonlinear stability system identification and control software toolbox for investigating nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic and ASE effects","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/301039","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Systems Company Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Multispacecraft Constellation Initialization and Trajectory Optimization using Genetic based Machine Learning Techniques","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/301041","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Scientific Systems Company Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/301501","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGIES CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/301587","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Scios, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"NON OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ANALOGS AS ANTI HBV AGENTS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/301797","abstract":"Not Available  We propose to design and build a generic aerosol collector and detector interface that will incorporate a MesoSystems aerosol collector, fluidic delivery system, lysis stage, electronic control system, and the Utah State University whole cell detector, which serves as an example of the types of BW detectors now emerging for military use.

We hope to overcome specific limitations of each system by incorporating complementary information from the other system. The thrust of our approach will be to determine specific regions of the sensors' mutual operational space where opportunities exist for synergistic fusion. Rather than first specifying a fusion approach and then testing it on various imagery, we will first analyze imagery to determine situations where detection rates can be increased and/or false alarm rates decreased by combining information from both sensors. For each such situation, we will test various promising fusion approaches and rank their effects on detection and false alarm rates using only imagery that is representative for the given situation. Finally, to automate the switching of fusion approaches, we will design a situation-adaptive expert system that determines when the missile enters a given situation based on sensed contextual information and on-board exogenous data sources. All sensor fusion approaches require co-registered imagery, but real-world sensors are frequently misaligned.

The innovation in this work is the use of discrete noise control sources that utilize feedback control to dissipate acoustic energy. Acoustic energy dissipation is a robust method of reducing sound pressure levels in the interior of the payload fairings. The goal of the research is to provide payloads with a quieter ride to orbit through new methods of active acoustic suppression in launch vehicles. The motivation for this work is the control of low-frequency in small to medium-sized launch vehicle payload fairings. Low-frequency noise is a problem in launch vehicle fairings due to the lack of significant energy dissipation below 200 to 300 Hz. The conventional method for reducing fairing sound pressure levels is to line the interior with sound absorbing acoustic blankets. Although very effective at higher frequencies, acoustic blankets provide less sound absorption at frequencies in which the acoustic wavelength is large compared to the thickness of the material. The effectiveness of the passive acoustic treatment is limited at low frequencies by the thickness of the blanket material.","agency":["Environmental Protection Agency"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Southwest Sciences, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"DNA BASE CALLING USING HETERODYNE FLUORESCENCE DETECTION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/312122","abstract":"Not Available  There is an exploding demand for high fidelity 3D models in a  variety of fields, both in the commercial and military sectors.

Lightweight, economical, low-no/erosion throat materials are critical to achievement of those goals. Carbon/carbon (C/C) composites are used in this application; however, in tactical motors using advanced propellants, these components exhibit unacceptably high erosion and oxidation rates. And although the cost of C/C is lower than that of most ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), the relatively long densification times (weeks) coupled with the cost of fibers and preform fabrication makes the material too expensive for many applications. Therefore, the two primary problems preventing more extensive use of C/C in SRMs are survivability and cost.

Advantages of this technique include computational efficiency, discrimination against noise and lack of a priori spectral assumptions. In Phase I we will create necessary data bases (tasks1, 2 and 5) to evaluate the approaches to atmospheric corrections (task 3) and the algorithms for sub-pixel target detection and identification (tasks 4 and 6). This work will lead to an improved understanding of the performance limitations of LWIR hyperspectral sensors. In Phase II we will develop and optimize detection and classification algorithms for selected sensors and determine sensor performance specifications. The Phase II software will be delivered to the USAF for evaluation in sensor system design.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Thunderhead Engineering Consultants, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Molecular Layer Chemical Vapor Deposition for Advanced Metallization","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/334724","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"TimeDomain CVD Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/334886","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"TISSUE ENGINEERING SCIS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"IN VITRO VASCULAR PERFUSION SYSTEM","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/334888","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"TISSUE ENGINEERING SCIS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Novel Suspension Bioreactor for Primary Hematopoietic Culture","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/334931","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Tissue Therapeutics","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/335085","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"TLC Precision Wafer Technology, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/335087","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"TLC Precision Wafer Technology, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/335172","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Toborg Associates, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/335289","abstract":"Not Available  This Phase I SBIR proposal is focused on shrouds for wide chord, low aspect ratio stage 1 fan blades.

It acquires the flutter/ASE sensitivity parameters using a unique computational aeroelastic/aeroservoelastic MDO/Analysis software tool ASTROS*/ASE, developed and advanced by ZONA under AFRL support since 1996.

(2) There is a need for further intelligibility improvements. The BioAcoustics concept integrates: three important performance features: (1) unique  high-damping earcup cushions  (hybrid material arrangement) in an anthropomorphically correct cushion configuration to significantly improve passive noise attenuation in low frequency bands; (2) adjustable position, low impedance, receiver to enhance the audio-receiver-to-ear-canal coupling; an (3) Digital Active Noise Attenuation to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

Having already developed software to make chess work within schools, we now plan to create software that will make chess competition possible between schools. We propose to create the first Internet Scholastic Chess League, establishing a practical and convenient competitive structure that will make it possible for chess to become a standard \"school sport\" in virtually any K-12 school, thereby enhancing its already valuable role in education. Although useful in any school setting, this may have particular impact in at-risk populations.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"VETGEN, LLC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Addressing Critical Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Challenges","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/345385","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"VEXCEL CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR TARGETING DNA VACCINE VECTORS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/345909","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"VICAL, INC.","reseach institution":"University of South Alabama"},{"title":"THERAPEUTIC DNA VACCINES TO TREAT B CELL LYMPHOMA","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/345911","abstract":"Not Available  The proposed Phase I program will design active noise and vibration reduction systems for the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV) in order to satisfy specific performance-based objectives.

These vehicles (as well as other tactical aircraft) use serpentine inlets to improve the stealth characteristics of the plane. Unfortunately, these serpentine ducts cause flow separation and increase the distortion at the engine and reduce its stability and performance. In this research program, fluidic actuators will be used for active flow control to prevent flow separation in serpentine gas turbine inlet ducts. Miniature ejector pumps, operated by bleeding high-pressure air from the engine, will provide boundary layer suction and blowing near the separation-prone areas in the inlet. An innovative approach of using MEMS-based microphones flush-mounted on the internal surface of the inlet to detect separated flow will be used to provide the error signal for the controller. Active control will then be used to operate miniature ejector pumps to ensure that the section/blowing scheme is most efficiently applied and that the maximum system benefit can be achieved. Recent experiments at Techsburg have demonstrated that boundary layer suction near separation-prone areas on gas turbine stator vanes can reduce the flow separation and the losses across the blade by as much as 40 percent. In addition, personnel at Techsburg have coupled active control with MEMS-based microvalves to reduce high-cycle fatigue (HCF) in gas turbine engines. Noise reductions of 10 dB were recorded.

However, due to limited tools for mapping complex arrhythmias, catheter ablation is much less effective when used to treat arrhythmias that are not constrained by known anatomic barries. The goal of this research is development of a novel system for endocardial mapping, one that combines anatomical information provided by fluoroscopic images with functional information provided by intracardiac electrograms. This system will provide clinicians with a powerful tool that will assist them in accurately mapping complex arrhythmias. During Phase I, a prototype version of the system was developed and installed in a clinical setting. The prototype system demonstrated the feasibility of the concept and the primary data processing algorithms. During Phase II, a full-featured, real-time version of the system will be developed and installed in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. The clinical utility of the system will be evaluated during a number of arrhythmia mapping procedures and used as a basis for developing a new mapping methodology.

For an economic and compact solution to this problem, there is the need for multi-function devices that combine splitting and amplification of light. Erbium-doped amplifiers have become well established in fiber form. However, their manufacture is today complex and costly. IFOS proposes to combine integrated-optic splitter fabrication with an innovative proprietary approach for manufacture of distributed photonic amplifiers. This will open up new application opportunities for amplifiers in subsystems intended for sensing, signal processing and communications. Our approach brings together processing technologies that are low-cost, low-temperature and lend themselves to dense integration and high-volume production. In Phase I, we will focus on materials-processing and analyze, fabricate and characterize active-glass waveguide films for proof-of-concept demonstration of low-cost and high gain-per-unit-length. In Phase II, we will demonstrate active-ridge-waveguides and then fabricate an optimized lossless splitters and begin commercialization activities.

deployable systems.  An ideal field unit for military and civilian use should be compact, efficient, reliable, and easy-to-operate.  This proposal addresses the development of such a system for producing sterile and pyrogen-free WFI from potable water. The proposed approach is based on a high-temperature method to achieve fast sterilization and depyrogenation, and to eliminate the possibility of bacteria and pyrogen buildup in any part of the system during the operation.  The focus of Phase I study is to experimentally demonstrate that six-orders of magnitude of pyrogen reduction can be achieved with contact times of a few seconds.  A laboratory-scale test apparatus will be built and used to generate water samples for biological analyses.   Temperature-time criteria will be established and used to size the prototype reactor for a 30-liter/hr system with overall dimensions similar to that of a household microwave oven. Commercially available pyrogen standards will be used as controls for evaluating the rates of pyrogen destruction.   Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) tests will be used to validate the water samples.  Good manufacturing practices will be followed in conducting the research. Developing the capability to produce sterile and pyrogen-free WFI from local potable water addresses the logistical problem of transporting and storing such material required by not only the U.S. Navy, but also other military branches.  WFI can be used to produce intravenous (IV) fluids and reconstitute freeze-dried blood products.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Applied Research Associates, Inc.","reseach institution":"University of New Mexico"},{"title":"Geographic Information System (GIS) Advancements for Mission Planning and Rehearsal","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/93798","abstract":"Not Available  Superconducting devices such as the volt standard required to be economically, reliably and compactly refrigerated to around 10K.

Similar to a bi-metallic strip, this sensor consists of a thin beam of a substrate material with a thin wafer of piezoelectric material bonded to one side, and a thin wafer of magnetostrictive material bonded to the other.  When the sensor is exposed to a magnetic field, the magnetostrictive material will strain thereby forcing the entire structure to bend. The bending will result in induced strain in the piezoelectric material and an induced voltage field across the piezoceramic.

However, the available bandwidth is very limited in battlefield that necessitates the use of video compression. Current standards such as MPEG-1 (Motion Pictures Experts Group) can only achieve a compression ratio of 400, i.e. from 472 Mbps to 1.2 Mbps. There are I (Intracoded), P (Predictive), B (Bidirectional), and D (DC-coded) frames in MPEG-1. Although D-frames are not necessary for military application since they are mainly used for fast-forward function in VCRs.  Thus one can eliminate D-frames to save some bandwidths. This is still not enough. The aim of this Phase 1 research is to develop a new technique that can achieve a compression ratio of 1000:1 so that it is feasible to use video in military command and control applications.  Here Intelligent Automation Incorporated (IAI) and Boston University propose a new overlapping block transform based wavelet coder (OBTWC) to compress video images.  The objective is to reduce the transmission time without sacrificing too much the performance of the image quality. Wavelet technology is a promising technique for image compression. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) has adopted a Wavelet Scalar Quantization technique to compress all fingerprints in its headquarter in Washington DC. FBI's technique achieves compression ratio of 18:1. We have applied our proposed new technique to fingerprint image compression. Our approach can achieve 26:1 with the same quality as the FBI coder. Therefore, we strongly believe that our algorithm can achieve 1000:1 compression ratio if we replace the DCT coding scheme in MPEG-1 by our OBTWC scheme.","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"APT AEROSPACE, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/95002","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Defense Threat Reduction Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"APTEK, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"(CODE): A Mission-Driven, Human-Centered Quantitative Approach","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/95062","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Aptima, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Streamlined Scenario-Based Methodology for Evaluation Distributed Team Performance","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/95064","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Aptima, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/95070","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Aptima, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Case Resource for Cognitive Task Analysis","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/95074","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Aptima, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Model-Based Performance Assessment for the Jobs of the 21st Century","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/95104","abstract":"Not Available  This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research Proposal details the technical and business strategies of Blue Sky Batteries to develop extremely high charge capacity polymers for use as cathodes in rechargeable lithium or lithium-ion based batteries.

Recent research has demonstrated the viability of an innovative new process for producing net-shaped carbon reinforced composites which avoids the use of costly fibers and complex forming procedures.  This is accomplished by the thermal decomposition of wood under controlled conditions to produce a porous carbon monolith which can be shaped by conventional low cost machining.  The shaped carbon serves as a scaffold for forming a composite via infiltration with a second phase without change in dimensions.  These carbons have been demonstrated to have compressive mechanical strengths that are superior to the precursor woods from which they are derived.  In addition, it has been shown that it is possible to activate these materials to yield surface areas similar to those produced by other charcoal activation processes.","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Arete Associates ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Missile Seeker 3D Imaging Ladar using a Streak Tube Imaging LIDAR (STIL)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/96636","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Arete Associates ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Mission Visual Planner","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/96927","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ARGON ENGINEERING ASSOC., INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Cryptologic Computer Architectures","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/96929","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ARGON ENGINEERING ASSOC., INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Content-Based Indexing and Retrieval in Global Information Databases Using Attributed Relational Graphs (ARG)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/97012","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"ARGTEC, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"AAAV Mineblast Attenuating Seat","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/97466","abstract":"Not Available  Sierra-Nevada Research and Development, Inc. proposes to develop a composite material for the production of high performance, compact heat exchange devices.

The most attractive aspect of DEW weapons lies in the fact that an electromagnetic missile is delivered at nearly speed of light, negating the advantage of increasing velocity of tactical missiles.  In the ideal soft kill, RF energy would couple into the target\u00bfs electronic systems and ultimately destroy the guidance and firing systems. Modem missile system use banks of discriminators to protect the receiver. An incoming signal is directed onto a delay line, with a small fraction of the signal directed to the discriminator crowbars the delay line, thus protecting the receiver. For a DEW to be effective against this line of defense, all of the discriminators must be destroyed, leaving the receiver vulnerable to the excessive amount of RF energy. Conventional DEW require excessive amount of energy and volume. These systems also require complex power supply, vacuum systems, and are driven by short-lived cathodes.

The transmitter will have inherently low relative intensity and phase noise characteristics (RIN and phase noise). The novel approach followed in this proposal is significantly different from past practices in two aspects. First, the host material for the solid state laser is an electrooptic crystal, LiNbO3, which provides efficient interaction between the optical and electric fields. Secondly, we are fully integrating the laser with the microwave components to reduce parasitics and provide a compact, rugged and low cost package.  Phase I concerns the feasibility study and design of the proposed solid-state mode-locked microchip laser.  Of particular interest is the achievement of low phase noise (< -110 dBc/Hz @ 1 KHz offset) and millimeter wave frequency tunability.  In Phase II we will develop a prototype transmitter to demonstrate superior performance and address the manufacturing process to allow successful commercialization in Phase III for military and non-military applications.","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"BOSTON MICROMACHINES CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Sub-millisecond High-voltage Spatial Light Modulator","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/113395","abstract":"Not Available  This Phase I program is to identify and perform research on novel film dielectric materials capable of being highly energetic with large dielectric constants, exhibiting excellent dissipation factor, indulation resistance, breakdown voltage, reliability and clearing ability.

especially important for military aircraft crews. On-board generation of high- pressure oxygen gas can decrease the ground support requirements for military (and commercial) aircraft by reducing the need for high-pressure oxygen transfer cylinders. Following preflight validation and in-flight qualification, the proposed oxygen  trickle charger  may be used to automatically replace oxygen in storage cylinders that has been consumed by aircrew personnel and/or lost through system leaks. The use of a water electrolyzer system as a  trickle charger  is ideal since the oxygen is generated from easily obtained consumables (electricity and a small amount of water). Such a system may be arbitrarily cycled on and off, oxygen generation and pressurization is accomplished with a minimal number of moving components, and the system is essentially maintenance free. The proposed system is compatible with the rigors of flight, including altitude, temperature extremes, orientation, dynamic loading, and is fully capable of performing real-time on-board diagnostics. In addition, the system is compact, lightweight, reliable, has a relatively low electrical power demand, and requires no special handling.

While superconducting generator technology has always promised very lightweight generators, these devices have been too unreliable for military applications.  Many of the design problems were caused by using cryogenic rotors with warm (non-cryogenic) stators. Reliable cryogenic generators must use cryogenic stators and cryogenic rotors.  Advances in high temperature superconductors (and other cryogenic conductors) may finally allow us to build practical cryogenic generators.  This proposed SBIR program will design two one-megawatt cryogenic stators, using state-of-the-art conductor and cooling technology.  One stator will be designed for low voltage missions (50-200 volts) and the other will be designed for high voltage missions (10,000-20,000 volts).

The contactless  MiRaD  detector can detect and quantify gamma-ray interactions in a material without directly collecting secondary particles and promises to offer properties far surpassing anything currently available.  The phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed detector technology and will generate performance specifications.  This will be accomplished through a combination of analytical modeling and experimental testing.","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Displaytech Incorporated","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/147846","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"DIVERSIFIED TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Shrink Fit Bling Shroud","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/147998","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"DIVERSITECH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/148430","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"DOMZALSKI MACHINE","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Pseudoelastic-Based Holders for Advanced Metal Foil and Fiber Brushes","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/148652","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"DPD, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Quantitative Microstructural Investigation of Concrete","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/148660","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"DPD, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/149079","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"D-Star Technologies, Inc.","reseach institution":"University of Southern California"},{"title":"Virtual Environment for Weapons Effects Visualization (VEWEV)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/149122","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"DUAL, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/149136","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"DUBBS & SEVERINO, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Affordable Nanophase Aluminum for Launch Vehicle Propulsion","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/149440","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"DWA ALUMINUM COMPOSITES","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/149680","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Dynaflow, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Titanium P/M Encapsulation of Ceramic With Hydrostatic Cushion for Ballistic Armor Applications","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/149794","abstract":"Not Available  Rapidly tunable lasers are essential for diffractive beam steering and for the detection of clandestine chemical emissions, chemical and biological warfare agents as well as concealed combustion engines or rocket propellents from missiles.

Polycrystalline SiGe and silicon with low carbon (0.05-0.2%, denoted as SiGe : C and Si : C) should inhibit boron diffusion/penetration. As gate oxide thickness shrinks in higher frequency devices, inhibition of boron penetration from polycrystalline gated during high temperature processing is a limiting issue in MOSFETs. Recently, small amounts of carbon in silicon and SiGe layers have domonstrated significantly inhibited boron diffusion. The most common means to reduce boron penetration is nitridation of the gate oxide, which may be less radiation hard. Additionally, as dielectric thickness decreases, nitrided layer thickness also shrinks, reducing its effect as a diffusion barrier. Suppression of boron penetration may ultimately require both nitrided gated dielectrics and carbon doped polycrystalline electrodes.

These BMMD materials could significantly enhance the performance of rechargeable lithium batteries, and are already the basis of an advanced Secondary Zinc Alkaline Manganese Dioxide (SZAMTM) battery technology. In the alkaline system the bismuth dopant confers deep (2-electron), reversible, cyclability to the MnO2. By complexing with soluble Mn(III) species, the bismuth serves as a redox catalyst, increasing the working voltage of the cell. Steric effects of the Bi-Mn complexes appear to prevent the formation of non-rechargeable MnO2 phases so that capacity fade in practical cells is low; 500 cycles are readily achieved. There is now direct evidence that BMMD materials can produce similar effects in rechargeable lithium systems, potentially translating into capacities of more than 500 Ah/kg and cell voltages of 3- 4+ Volts, if the same level of benefit can be achieved. Solution-phase structural stabilization constitutes an entirely new approach toward the development of manganese oxides for rechargeable lithium batteries. In this Phase I SBIR development program, various structural forms of BMMD will be incorporated into the cathode of button cells with lithium anodes and evaluated for specific capacity, cyclability and fade.

This is driving the development of 100 GHz or greater IC technology for A/D converters, synthesizers, MUX/DEMUXs, DDSs, and PRNs. At microwave frequencies, InP HEMT devices have demonstrated the best combination of gain, noise figure, and linearity. But the InP substrate is very expensive. The price of a raw 3-inch InP substrate(~$800) is comparable to the cost of a 4-inch GaAs PHEMT wafer.

The existing methodology uses the computer program FOCAL-P that has worked satisfactorily with regards to accuracy of predictions. However, the speed of computations in FOCAL-P is an order of magnitude too slow for the Navy's needs. This proposal outlines three tasks that specifically address the need for a near real-time algorithm to predict the cable behavior during installation. The first is to study the computational efficiency of FOCAL-P. Understanding the computational bottlenecks in the present code is essential to making improvements. The second task involves a novel approach to predicting the micro-cable response in the marine environment. This approach applies numerical algorithms, such as choice of coordinate systems, coordinate transformations and equations of motion solutions that have been successfully used in the prediction of aircraft and missile trajectories to the current problem. The last task involves real-time graphical visualization of the cable as it is being installed on the seafloor.

The proposed micro-valve will be a MEMS device that is electrostatically operated (low power) and capable of regulating the required suction.

Results from preliminary experiments indicate a potential two-order magnitude reduction in suction rate from conventional techniques.  This program will design, fabricate and test this innovative, self-clearing MEMS micro-valve.

By precisely controlling growth parameters, compositional variations can be incorporated in crystalline materials.  These compositional variations result in an associated refractive index grating that can form a DBR.  Optics based on this technology would be tunable and have high damage thresholds.

Recent, substantial progress by Krispin Technologies, Inc., in developing 3D vortex methods for turbulent flow simulation as part of a DOE supported SBIR Phase II project will be leveraged to yield immediate application to realistic hazard scenarios of interest to DTRA.  Among these are scalar plumes emanating from multiple sites within confined or open air domains.  The unique capabilities of vortex methods derive from the versatility of their grid-free character; their computational speed; and, their capacity to represent essential physical properties of turbulent flow.  In particular, they are better positioned to model the essential effect of small scale vortices on scalar mixing than traditional grid-based closure and large eddy simulation techniques relying on unphysical diffusive models.  The accuracy of the proposed methodology will be tested for scalar plumes in atmospheric flows under a variety of conditions as well as for turbulent jets.  Subsequently, methods for quantifying mixing between species will be devised and then applied to problems for which scalars originate from separate sources.  The proposed new technology is important to DTRA interests and is applicable to a broad range of DTRA and defense applications.  It can be readily adapted for civilian use; it can be utilized for better analysis and control of numerous industrial activities, ranging from chemical to energy applications, natural and industrial pollution, and other health hazards.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"GERACE COMBUSTION GROUP","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Structural Design for Increased Productivity and Reduced Distortion","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/175380","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"GIBBS & COX, INC.","reseach institution":"Edison Welding Institute"},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/175558","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Giner, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Integrated, Light-Weight Regenerative Fuel Cell-Electrolyzer System","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/175588","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Giner, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"High Pressure, Electrochemical Oxygen System Trickle Charger","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/175592","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Giner, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/175600","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Giner, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Development of High Energy Electrochemical Capacitor Stack for Military Vehicular Applications","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/175611","abstract":"Not Available  The proposed effort will develop and demonstrate an imbedded protection technique for integrated electromagnetic protection of military systems and COTS equipment.

Treaty monitoring and verification activities require the rapid collection and chemical analysis of samples at suspected chemical warfare (CW) agent-producing facilities.  Current on-site analysis procedures are slow, thus hindering the effectiveness of verification operations.  Sensor devices for both accurate prescreening of collected samples for the presence of signature chemicals associated with CW agents, and for selectively pinpointing areas to be sampled, are needed.  Such sensors should be inexpensive, have low logistics burden, and use very little power.  Sensitive, specific detection of signature compounds under these demanding conditions requires a novel approach.  Physical Sciences, Inc. proposes to develop a small, inexpensive, and rugged microsensor device for chemical warfare agents and associated signature chemicals which can actively sample an environment and selectively indicate the identity and quantity of these species.  These signature compounds include live G, V, and H agents, agent precursors (used in agent production) such as dichlor and difluor, and agent decomposition products such as the phosphonic acids.  In Phase I a prototype microsensor wil be demonstrated and a preliminary design of the Phase II device will be completed. The proposed microsensor will provide a significant improvement in the detection of signature chemicals associated with chemical warfare agents, and thus will enhance the protection of the civilian and military population. The underlying technology is versatile and can be readily adapted to specific detection of commercially important species including pesticides, environmental pollutants, biomolecules, and odorants.

Depositing these filters directly on a focal plane array can reduce the sensor's size, customize the detector to a specific application, and allow for retrofitting the capability and function of the smart sensor without the need to modify the optical train.  Rugate optical interference filters provide high optical throughput while providing laser protection.  By using low Z, thermally matched materials, these filters offer radiation and x-ray survivability as well as laser protection.  The refractive index of rugate filters, continuously varied as a function of the film's optical thickness, is achieved by blending materials during deposition.  In addition to refractive index, other physical properties can be adjusted to mitigate the effects of ionizing radiation and thermal gradients.  For instance, a narrow bandpass coating can be applied to a focal plane array used in a scanning sensor.  The wavelength of the passband can be varied from pixel to pixel, giving the array spectral discrimination across the scanning axis.  This Phase I program will serve to develop a methodology for coating temperature-sensitive substrates.  Several filters, using selected materials, will be fabricated to demonstrate spectral performance, low temperature compatibility, and low defects and stress. Innovative rugate filters improve spectral performance, add capability, and harden sensors to laser and nuclear radiation.  In addition, depositing the filters directly on a focal plane array can reduce the sensor's size and customize the detector to specific applications.  Applications are many and varied, from threat hardening to hyperspectral sensors to thermal control.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase

Users will not only have standard symbol libraries and databases, but will also have the ability to add their own particular mission requirements.  Predictive analysis plug-ins will have the option of a graphical interface to CAD, GIS or both.  This approach will allow integration of different threat specific plug-ins to a common interface, thus reducing the learning curves and placing decision aids in the hands of true first responders.

These snap-shots will reveal the structure of instabilities in the pinch and allow us to correlate improved power coupling to the pinch and higher radiation efficiency with mitigation of such instabilities.

The Phase-II instrument will thus be a more comprehensive tool for z-pinch development.  The Phase III effort will commercialize the instrument and supply models to DoD and DOE laboratories engaged in PRS research as well as modify the instrument for other commercial applications such as the combustion diagnostic tool.

With the accurate simulation of the near surface stress history all subsequent vehicle responses must then be a good representation of those induced by the nuclear threat.  A Mag Flyer impact at atmospheric pressure is the highest fidelity simulation shapes the induced stress wave profile.  A major limitation on the accuracy and repeatability of magnetic flyer plate experiments is that the load magnitude and temporal history are sensitive functions of the flight distance.  When operating in air, the desired loading conditions can only be achieved with short flight distances and the normal RB tolerances limit the accuracy of the experiment.  This proposal presents unique experimental solutions that allow the flyer plate distance to be significantly increased while maintaining the desired load magnitude and temporal history.  These changes decrease the sensitivity of the magnetic flyer technique to flight distance changes due to experiment assembly and/or within tolerance dimensional variations and eliminates a major limitation of the magnetic flyer technique.  The feasibility of using alternate gases and modifying the capacitor bank to tailor the  gas spring  response to allow larger flight distances will be examined in Phase I.  Ktech's analyses have determined that the flight distance can be doubled by the use of an alternate gas such as neon.  Capacitor bank modifications that modify the ringing frequency of the bank and/or shape the current pulse will also be examined because achieving constant flyer velocity at early times also facilitates the use of large flight distances.  A Phase Ii program plan will be developed that describes the necessary modification to the DTRA Mag Flyer Facility to implement gas spring technology and the required facility characterization program. The gas spring technology will decrease the sensitivity of mag flyer techniques to dimensional tolerances of the test articles and will significantly increase the Mag Flyer Facility capabilities to meet specific experiment requirements in terms of peak stress and specific impulse.  Additionally, load uncertainties will be reduced.  The improved facility will provide a cost effective AGT capability for selection and hardness evaluation of new materials and the certification of modified systems.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"INDIGO SYSTEMS CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Advanced Read-Out Integrated Circuit for Quantum wel Infrared Photodetector Array","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/189653","abstract":"Not Available  This proposal addresses the need for a fast running, multi-purpose fire simulation computer code for Weapon System Safety Assessments (WSSAs), with direct applicability to the evaluation of threats to/from weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  This proposal would extend the Isis-2D fire code to 3-dimensions while maintaining its  fast running  attributes essential to practical risk analysis.  The proposed effort would also extend the code's existing flexibility to address issues related to hazards associated with WMD.  In its present form as a 2-dimensional code, Isis-2D has limitation relative to accurately representing complex  real world  problems.  Due to (a) the highly 3-dimensional nature of fires, (b) the 3-dimensional complexity of  real world  environments, and (c) the 3-dimensional interactions between the fires and the real world, the evaluation of  real world  fires requires a 3-dimensional mechanistic code.  In addition, to support the scoping nature and thus the requirement for large number of risk-compatible evaluation, Isis also satisfies the necessary requirement of flexible modeling attributes and fast computational run times. The results from this research have several anticipated benefits to DTRA.  First, a fast-running, 3-dimensional fire model would help reduce uncertainties and reliance on engineering judgment.  Second, we have identified many conditions or phenomena where a 3-dimensional tool would provide a defensible method to reduce requirements for conservatism.  The ultimate objective is to reduce the likelihood of needless recommendations for costly procedure or hardware changes.  Finally, completion of such a tool will allow, with little additional effort, a general-purpose code for the analysis of fire challenges and subsequent behavior (e.g., transport, decomposition, inhalation, and deposition) of biological and chemical agents in weapons of mass destruction.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"INDIGO SYSTEMS CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Near Surface Imaging in Soils for Archeological Assessments","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/189899","abstract":"Not Available  To protect the US against limited nuclear attacks, the NMD system must operate successfully in nuclear-disturbed environments.  A key to successfully negating nuclear threat is selecting a battleplan that ensures that NMD system performance is not too severely degraded by nuclear effects.  While prompt nuclear effects are easy to plan around, persistent nuclear environments are more problematic, especially with the fast-running, lower-fidelity algorithms that BMC2 must use.  MRC has long been among the nation's leaders in predicting nuclear environments and their impacts on system performance. We will combine this experience with expertise in artificial neural networks (ANN) to develop and train an ANN for use as a real-time decision aid in selecting optimal battleplans that minimize direct and collateral nuclear impacts.  We will develop our decision aid so it can be used as an integral element in the BMC2 battleplanning process, dynamically responding to an evolving threat and providing risk assessments that would not otherwise be available.  It will assess multiple battleplans, then inform a human in control (HIC) of the probability of success and costs/benefits of each plan so they will be adequately informed when selecting an actual battleplan. The Phase I effort will demonstrate that a neural network can be trained to predict the outcome of a candidate NMD battleplan in the presence of possible nuclear bursts.  It will provide the human-in-control with an assessment of the nuclear-induced risks to the performance of vital elements in the system.  Similar decision aids could be developed for other ballistic missile defense program, such as THAAD, Navy TMD, or even the Israeli Arrow program.

In this Phase I proposal. Image Corp, Inc. proposes a system for SAR-based vehicle detection that makes extensive use of contextual information derived from the SAR image itself.  Multi-resolution and fast non-Gaussian algorithms will be used to make the processing both robust and fast.  The key to achieving robustness is the construction and use of a detailed 2-D  site model  from the SAR image, which delineates roads, buildings, trees, shadow regions and open terrain.  Candidate vehicles are detected using a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) technique followed by filtering and post-processing.  False alarms resulting from man-made structures such as buildings as well as those resulting from vegetation are detected using the site model.  Image Corp's proposal is based on the work at the University of Maryland of the research group of Prof. Rama Chellappa, whose outstanding contributions to SAR image exploitation are widely recognized.  The proposed work will be invaluable in improving battlefield awareness and in peace-keeping efforts.

However, the high costs associated with difficulty in fabricating prototypes and small production runs presents significant barriers. Selective Gelation Printing, SGP, is an innovative solid freeform fabrication technology that can directly create very high quality preforms from CAD-generated solid model, thereby eliminating non-valued added steps and part specific tooling. This increased flexibility will enable rapid design changes, dramatically reducing cost and lead time involved in developing and fabricating DRA parts from months to weeks. DRA materials can be designed and synthesized with novel microstructures such as functionally gradient compositions. Phase I will build the alpha SGP system and establish feasibility in building porous ceramic preforms with specifiable volume fraction. Test articles will be characterized for dimensional accuracy, homogeneous particle distribution, and volume fraction and to verify cost performance benefits. Phase 2 goals include developing fully integrated beta SGP system capable of faster build times with expanded preform material and design capability.

The vehicle for that exploration is a radiation hard CMOS APS test chip that has been designed, fabricated, and packaged.  This test chip will be irradiated and then its performance will be evaluated.  Based on the results from this test chip, a second generation of radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors will be designed, simulated, and made ready for submission for fabrication.  Photobit has recently completed a research project that concluded that radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors are feasible.  The combination of employing the physical design techniques of enclosed geometry and guard rings, and a deep sub-micron standard CMOS  fabrication process provides the path to radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors.  Utilizing commercial standard CMOS fabrication processes to realize radiation hard image sensors makes every economic sense.  The cost element associated with these standard processes is less (by a factor of 2) than that associated with specialized radiation hard processes.  The same amount of research dollars can go further when new design concepts are tested via the more cost-effective standard fabrication processes. Radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors will be a welcome alternative to the inherently radiation soft charge-coupled device (CCD) APS image sensors.  Radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors perform as well as CCDs, with the added benefits of lower power (10 to 100 times less) and integration of electronics (enabling miniaturization).  This allows them to not only compete in th same markets as CCDs, but also provide opportunities to expand the existing image sensor market.  The proposed radiation hard image sensor and the technical advances associated with its development are extremely important for space applications (DoD, NASA, and commercial satellites) and ground-based radiation harsh environment systems such as nuclear power plants, particle accelerators, and radiation test facilities.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"KaZaK Composites Incorporated","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/208210","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"KELLEY'S LOGISTICS SUPPORT SYSTEMS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Autonomic Logistics","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/208234","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"KELLY LOGISTICS SUPPORT SYSTEMS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"New Generation of Atomic Clocks- Physics","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/208537","abstract":"Not Available  Carbon-carbon(CC)composite materials are materials that consist of carbon fiber reinforcing a matrix of carbon.

To enable operation in real-world environments, the system employs a particle filter and magnetic immunobeads to clean and concentrate the target analytes in the solution.  A highly compact, imaging, optical arrangement subsequently monitors the sample fluid for a large number of analytes in parallel.  By using a photo induced immobilization technique, a multitude of different antibodies is immobilized on the surface of a glass carrier, each type being located at a specific position on the chip.  When sample fluid containing the analytes is flowed over the sensor surface, the top plane of the optical carrier chip is interrogated by an imaging ellipsometer to provide a spatially resolved measurement of the sample surface.  This allows precise monitoring of binding events to the individual sensor fields.  Use of semiconductor sources enables highly compact realization; employing several wavelengths further enhance the sensitivity.  The imaging technique yields highly resolved information about the binding status of a vast number of different antibody fields without the need for labeling reagents.

This proprietary process, with which we have succeeded in upgrading dramatically the performance of an electrochromic polymer-based switch for rf electromagnetic waves, allows formation from its appropriately functional group-altered monomer of virtually any electroactive polymer, rather than the very few that lend themselves to casting from solution.  Triton is therefore able to design miniaturized conductimetric chemisensors with bandgaps tailored for differential response to the redox potentials of chemical-biological warfare components and ambient interferents.  We are able to confine deposition of the polymer film to the spaces between interdigitated metallic electrodes by making use of a company-developed thermally activated mask.  This production method both allows precise control of the (submicron) thickness of this volatiles-sensitive layer and further increases its change in resistance with analyte arrival rate by giving it a highly porous exposed surface.  The objective of Triton's research will be to formulate robust, long shelflife sub-ppm threshold response microsensors with enhanced discrimination of specific airborne CBW agents and precursors. Conductive polymer-based vapor concentration sensors are currently being applied for assessing the quality of food products and their as-received raw materials, the protection provided by packaging, and the threat from noxious and hazardous gases or aerosols in workplaces (among others, pesticide-treated areas and the ESA / MIR Space Station crew cabin).

These are based on the precept that the limiting factor for coatings is the fundamental connection between static and dynamic properties which often requires that the most effective treatments have the greatest ship impact. The fundamental governing relationships are (for treatments in which the properties vary slowly with frequency, including modern designs) dictated by the requirement that the static modulus cannot exceed the dynamic modulus. This consequence of linear system causality is difficult to circumvent. The first concept is an optimization of the ratio of static to dynamic moduli of current coating concepts by crosslinking during or immediately after installation. The second employs embedded resonant structures with rapidly varying properties with frequency which can be stiffer statically than dynamically. Both macroscopic and microscopic resonant structures (using MEMS technology) will be evaluated.

Lithium is generally considered to be too reactive, and evolves hydrogen as a parasitic reaction, but exhibits a very negative OCP (-3 VSCE). We have extensively studied the lithium/water system and have found that lithium in alkaline electrolytes forms a bilayer passive film (LiH and LiOH) at the metal/electrolyte interface. LiH forms as a thin, compact inner layer that forms on the surface of the lithium metal. The outer layer is a porous precipitated LiOH layer that forms on the LiH layer. The outer layer is found to regulate lithium dissolution. However, the passive film does not completely inhibit hydrogen evolution, leading to poor coulombic efficiency during discharge. We propose to substitute the naturally created passive layer with a cationically conducting polymer membrane, which is placed on the lithium surface. The role of the membrane is to suppress the hydrogen evolution while permitting lithium discharge. Our initial experiments performed with polyphosphazene membranes have been encouraging, but they point to a need to more carefully design the polymer in terms of the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. We believe that the extraordinary energy densities that are available with lithium, together with the fact that metal/water batteries can be mechanically (and hence rapidly) refuelled, renders them ideal for a wide range of stationary power applications in both domestic and military service.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"LSA","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Smart Wide-Field Broadband Filters for Eye Protection","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/218993","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Defense","Air Force","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Lumin, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"On-Board Electrolyzer Based High-Pressure Oxygen Generator System for Aircrew Breathing Oxygen","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219501","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Integrated Energy Supply and Wing Structure for Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219513","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Novel On-Board Wastewater Treatment System for Naval Vessels","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219519","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219527","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"On-Site Production and Sterilizatoin of Intravenous Solutions","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219607","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":"Texas Engineering Experiment Station"},{"title":"Novel Lithography Stages Fabricated from High Performance Composite Materials","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/220626","abstract":"Not Available  Innovative device designs and novel growth and fabrication techniques will be investigated to provide a significant improvement in the operational characteristics of A1GaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTS).

Motivating factors for continued research in adaptive flight control technology include, but are not limited to the potential for reduced development costs and the increased design versatility afforded airframe designers. Although there are few adaptive autopilots flying today, some success has been achieved in industry in the adaptive control of air vehicles.  The price that is typically paid with adaptive control techniques, however is algorithm and software complexity.    These complexities increase significantly when the controllers are forced to operate in regions where the vehicle aerodynamics are highly non-linear.  We have developed a break-though approach in adaptive vehicle control that is virtually trivial to implement, is highly robust, and is easily adaptable to the non-linear scenario.

The type-II QW photodiodes would have comparable quantum efficiency and smaller dark current due to a larger effective mass, and enhanced lifetimes due to much slower Auger recombination rates, and hence much longer carrier lifetime. Through careful bandgap engineering, we have suppressed the Auger coefficient by a factor > 8 for 4.5-mm type-II QW mid-IR lasers at 300 K.  With improved MBE growth technology, we have improved the responsivity of type-II photoconductors by a factor 50, due to the improved interface quality.

In addition, these complex interactions must be represented across a range of stressor types in an efficient and user-friendly manner.  Emergent  simulations enabled by autonomous agents can be used to address this deficiency in CGF technology. Complex global behaviors of a group of agents can result from simple local interactions of these agents. Such a framework would be robust since it does not rely on rigidly scripted rules.

The proposed fractal architecture will consist of three elements: 1) An interface specification and framework for coding primitive modules using traditional programming languages. 2) A new fractal language for composing primitive modules into components, components into more capable components, and components into programs.  3) A distributed agile run-time system to execute these fractal programs, which is able to migrate tasks between processors to balance system loads and resurrect tasks to recover from hardware failures.  The Phase I effort will design these three facets of the architecture as well as develop examples illustrating how the architecture would be used, how the system reacts to stress, and prediction of its run-time scalability and performance.  Phase II will focus on implementing a prototype and conducting detailed performance evaluations.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NAVSYS CORPORATION, THE","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/242354","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"NAVSYS CORPORATION, THE","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Digital Spaceborne Antenna System for All-in-View GPS Satellite Visibility","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/242356","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NAVSYS CORPORATION, THE","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/242362","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"NAVSYS CORPORATION, THE","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Navigation/Electro-optic Sensor Integration Technology (NEOSIT)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/242384","abstract":"Not Available  Marine coatings are the key materials used to protect metals against corrosion and obtain the full design service life from ships. Marine anticorrosion coatings have a significant economic impact and any breach in the anticorrosion coating that may occur due to abrasion or during docking must be repaired as quickly as possible. The most difficult portion of a ship to recoat and repair with anticorrosion coatings is the underwater hull because repairs must be done under water by divers to avoid expensive dry- docking. The present repair coating formulation disintegrates during application causes the water to be cloudy, blurs the diver's vision and contaminates the marine life. Foster-Miller proposes to develop a high performance, environmentally compliant, non-toxic, no VOC (100% solids) hull touch up repair coating that can be applied underwater without hindering the performance of the application team. The proposed repair coating will adhere well to underwater substrates, cure while immersed in water and have sufficient water-resistance so that it doesn't disintegrate and obscure vision during application. Our proposed ADHER repair-coating formulation will also provide good adhesion, toughness, anti-blush and water resistance properties, and will readily accept additional coatings that can be applied during dry- docking.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NAVSYS CORPORATION, THE","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/242637","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"NanoScale Materials, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Designing Enhanced Performance Polycarbonate Nanocomposites by Incorporation of Reinforcing Silicate Sheets or Silsesquioxane Clusters","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/242838","abstract":"Not Available  The comminutors and transfer pumps used to process and discharge sewage from Navy vessels are the two primary components requiring the most service/maintenance.

Visual displays which transform the time-domain signals into the frequency domain and which average the signals over time are currently used for target detection and tracking.

Sonar operators do not listen to the VLF signals because current hardware and signal processing techniques are not effective in this frequency range. Creare will develop a hardware and signal processing system to optimize VLF audio signals for human operator hearing. The system will enable frequency translation and compensation so that the optimized signal can be calibrated to the hearing response of a specific sonar operator.

Though this protocol is very successful, there are many things for which it is not well suited, and a variety of efforts have been initiated to revise the standard to address these shortcomings. About four years ago the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) launched an ambitious program to develop a technology, known generally as Active Networking (AN), intended to address this problem of slow deployment. An active network is one in which the routers can be customized to run communication- oriented protocols on a per-user, per-flow, or even per-packet basis. In particular, users are allowed to deploy or invoke programs within the network rather than just at endpoints. This allows a range of new protocols to be deployed quickly within the network by programming them using a more high-level interface. The goal of this proposal is to take steps to commercialize one of the most successful and widely-used active network technologies, and take a first step toward developing applications based on that technology through an experiment on the ABONE. The basic technology is that of PLAN, the Packet Language for Active Networks, designed by the SwitchWare Project at the University of Pennsylvania. The application is endpoint emulation, a service in which an active router serves as a proxy for a destination that becomes temporarily inaccessible. Such a service would allow certain kinds of communication between two endpoints even if they were never connected to one another at the same time due to erratic network connectivity or the unavailability of the endpoints themselves. The resulting service is much more general than an  answering-machine  since it does not require designation of specific proxy to hold the message.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Optra, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Focal Geometric Array Design for Guidance","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/251995","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Nova Research, Inc.

These studies show that the source can produce high average power radiation in every IR atmospheric transmission window of interest and therefore, it has the potential to provide efficacious countermeasures for high value, high signature platforms, which presently have only very limited protection. The novel source is based on the interaction of a beat wave with non-linear media. The beat wave is formed from the mixing of two carbon dioxide laser beams with closely spaced wavelengths, such as 9.5 and 9.6 microns. The studies by LET Corporation, as well as the original studies of the IR source are based on the supposition that the beat wave is formed by two distinct carbon dioxide lasers that provide two closely spaced wavelengths. Since the weight, size and cost of the driver exceed, by far, the weight, size and cost of any other component of the IR source, replacing the two carbon dioxide lasers with a single laser would substantially reduce the weight, size and cost of the system. A scheme is proposed that has the potential to produced two closely spaced wavelengths from a single carbon dioxide laser line. The scheme is based on the modulation instability, which is a general characteristic of many dispersive, non-linear media.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NOVATE CO.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"High-Speed &#039;Hot Chip&#039; Motherboard with Low-Cost High-Pressure Polycrystalline Diamond Heat Spreader.","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252389","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NOVATEK","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Ultra broadband Er3+ Doped Tellurite Glass Fiber Amplifier","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252677","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NP Photonics, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Waveguide Routers for Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing Systems","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252681","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NP Photonics, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252691","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"NP Photonics, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Novel Class of Ultra-high-speed Optical Switches","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252702","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NP Photonics, Inc.","reseach institution":"University of Arizona"},{"title":"Reconfiguring Surface Terrain Robot","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252826","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"NRG RESOURCE SYSTEMS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Fatigue Life Modeling of Composite Bonded Joints in Rotorcraft Structures","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/252869","abstract":"Not Available  We propose a thermal spray process to deposit thin-film cathodes and anodes on rugged substrates to replace the thick, fragile, pressed pellets currently used in thermal batteries.

The plasma-spray process is readily transitioned to the production environment; our existing plasma-spray equipment is the same equipment as used in production facilities. We propose to deposit cathode and anode materials in Phase I and to characterize their morphologies to demonstrate that the thermal spray process is a feasible approach to manufacturing thin components for thermal batteries.

The HBC will be small, lightweight optical element and it will be inexpensive. The fabrication of the HBC is based on the storage of multiple holographic gratings in the same spatial location.  Until now, this has been difficult and inefficient due to material issues.  With the advent of polymer with diffusion amplification, PDA, multiple holographic gratings can be efficiently stored in a single location on a holographic plate.  Using a large dynamic range, this material can combine 20 holograms with a combined output that has more than 90% of the combined input power.  This is the key advantage of this particular holographic material over others. For the purposes of this proposal, information from several different laser beams will be multiplexed as holograms in the PDA material.  These multiplexed holograms can then work to redirect or combine the output from the laser beams of the ladar system simultaneously, thereby forming a single, high energy beam.

The Infrared camera will have a wide field of regard to allow for wide area detection. The system will be capable of autonomously detecting objects as small as one centimeter in diameter (i.e. wires) at a range of at least 600 meters. It will operate in day/night and in all weather conditions. Height, width, and range of the obstacle is determined with minimal processing time to allow ample time for the pilot or crew to avoid the obstacle. An audio and visual alarm will be provided to the pilot or crew. Packaging for this system will be designed for a low risk and low cost retrofit to existing fixed and rotary wing aircraft. All the hardware will be designed to work in a military aircraft, meeting the vibration, temperature, EMI/EMP, and environmental conditions.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PHOTONIC BIOSYSTEMS, INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/262318","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"PACIFIC WAVE INDUSTRIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/262321","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"PACIFIC WAVE INDUSTRIES, INC.","reseach institution":"University of Southern California"},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/262463","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Pacific-sierra Research Corp.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Latch-Up Detection and Cancellation in CMOS VLSI Circuits","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/262517","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PADGETT-MARTIN TECHNOLOGY","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Five-Resonator Ceramic Bandpass Filter","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/263457","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PARATEK, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"High Performance Tunable Filter for the Elimination of Cosite Interference Using Novel Low Loss Ferroelectric Varactors","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/263459","abstract":"Not Available  The need to add wireless capability to many different types of devices continues to grow.

Fractal scalable systems will have constant perceived complexity (from the viewpoint of users and developers) while providing support for increased complexity and growth.  Dynamic adaptation provides numerous benefits to software systems and leads to a new development paradigm where applications are fluidly assembled, modified and enhances at runtime.  This paradigm is based on interoperable components that can be manipulated visually (or using other intuitive assembly metaphors) within running applications.  The paradigm also provides implicit support for workflow-based processing at the application level; components can be shared among widely distributed systems, and applications are seamlessly transported between end users and create on the fly.

Even when arrays of receivers are used in extant sonars, their function is to increase the beam forming precision or to steer the sonar beam.  Dolphins, in contrast, appear to use their two ears somewhat separable.  Binaural processing adds significant information about the structure of the target in both time and frequency-domain representations of the signal.  Studies with speech signals indicate a 5dB performance gain when using two receivers, relative to a single receiver.  Similar improvements can be expected in the proposed biomimeteic sonar.  To test this model, we will construct a binaural data-acquisition system capable of precise positioning and able to move freely in three dimensions as dolphins do when searching for fish.

The centrifugal separation is effective in separating debris which has higher specific gravity than that of the DFM for particles as small as 20 microns. CFF is especially effective for feed flow with colloidal solids. Unlike dead-end filtration, the surface dynamics of CFF does not make gelatinous colloidal solids (which often get carried into fuel oil by seawater) extrude through filter pores, and thus does not compromise the performance of filtration. CFF makes use of the shear force parallel to the filter medium to reduce the cake formation on the filter surface. Dean flow is a secondary flow created in a curved flow passage. The resulting flow profile takes the form of a toroidal vortex. The vortex profile generates a high shear rate which acts to transport material such as colloidal solids and fine silts away from the membrane surface. The combination of these features with an automatic back-flushing device forms a compact, self-cleaning, and continuously operable unit suitable for pre-filtration in Navy shipboard fuel oil systems.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"CREARE LLC ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Experiment Support Facility for Structures and Control","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/267326","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Payload Systems, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Silicon-on-Sapphire GPS System on a Chip","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/268421","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PEREGRINE SEMICONDUCTOR CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Probabilistic Micromechanical Fatigue Model for Intermetallics","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/268843","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PERSYST DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Optical Cooling by means of Anti-Stokes Fluorescence in Molecular Systems","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/268896","abstract":"Not Available  The Navy's submarine fleet continues to experience premature failures in submarine outboard electrical cable connectors across many CWS and HM&E systems due to water ingress into the connector.

A series of parametric computer models will be used to analyze the maximum pressure and required vent activation pressure and cross-sectional area, after determination of the maximum credible incident for the AAAV box. A prototype cross-section test specimen will be manufactured to validate and demonstrate key features of the optimized design.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Liquid Crystal Tunable Polarization Filter","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/272008","abstract":"Not Available  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed to development of a prototype oxygen generation system design capable of delivering oxygen at 2 to 4 ambient liters per minute and generated at a pressure level of 2500 psig to trickle- charge a storage source.

The algorithms developed here result in reduced training data support and computational requirements utilizing a priori information regarding the structure underlying the interference. Because these algorithms are based on interference consisting of a small number of strong low rank interferers plus white noise, they permit development of powerful data matrix-based methods that also offer potential for considerably reduced training data support and computational complexity. The algorithms afford the capability of a constant false alarm rate(CFAR) and permit the design of robust receiver structures. Performance analysis using realistic simulated data and real data from experiments using a UESA circular array is presented. Simulation techniques for data generation from an idealized circular array and a practical circular array, including relevant radar parameters, are developed. The algorithms resulting from this research permit rapid localization of dominant interference subspaces, enabling fast adaptation intervals which are fractions of a coherent processing interval(CPI). Consequently, these algorithms are suitable for use in severely non-homogeneous and nonstationary interference backgrounds.

First, it requires at least one high-gain auxiliary channel (each such channel entails an independent, full gain, beamformer,) and second, the post-cancellation main-beam residues are normally too distorted to allow for a meaningful angle measurement capability. The mainbeam cancellation approach that we propose below obviates these difficulties. It utilizes an innovative beamforming technique that provides several major advantages. First, it enables the radar to steer the pattern difference nulls toward the jammer within the same dwell at which jamming is first detected, and to implement the steering more accurately than is possible via the antenna phase shifters. Second, it makes it possible to adaptively cancel jamming residues in the difference patterns using multiple available high gain channels, without incurring undue pattern distortions. Third, it enables target detection in the jamming sanitized difference channels. Fourth, it enables a measure of angle estimation based on difference channel ratios sanitized from jamming. And fifth, it accomplishes all of the above using only minor modifications to the conventional monopulse beamforming architecture, and increasing the number of receive channels by a modest amount.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION","reseach

Newer network applications require a minimum of T1 data rate (1.544 Mbps). The network must also be robust for the operating conditions of VSATs- small diameter dishes with inaccurate tracking and a cluttered terrain environment. Most commercial VSAT modems support data rates in the range of 64-128 kbps but those that do support higher data rates require significantly more transponder bandwidth and larger antenna sizes. CDMA is a perfect solution for VSATs where increased complexity and transponder bandwidth is not an option. Sigtek has identified the VSAT network market as a target ideal for the further development of our existing direct sequence modems. Using our CDMA technology, we can develop a CDMA network that solves these problems. Our existing hardware supports flexible spreading codes, variable data rates, and several types of FEC. Combined with further analysis and simulation we can develop the parameters for a VSAT network that solves many of these problems. Investigation of types of FEC, spreading codes, and interference reduction will be critical in achieving a Phase II deployment.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Powdermet, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Linear Motor Technology in the Vertical Plane","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/279217","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"POWER SUPERCONDUCTOR APPLICATIONS CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/279873","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"PRECISION CONTROL DESIGN, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Detection of Biological Agents and Pathogens in Water","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/280024","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Office for Chemical and Biological Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PRECISION RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"High Throughput Terminal/CDMA Modem for Satellite Communications","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/280130","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PREDICTION SYSTEMS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Defensive Information Operations Planning Tool","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/280132","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"PREDICTION SYSTEMS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Application of Conformable Tactile Sensor (CTS) for Head Pressure Analysis System (HPAS)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/280316","abstract":"Not Available  TACAN will develop a new optical cable plant for avionics applications and identify cables and harnesses, connectors, splices, break-out boxes, backplane interfaces, and fiberoptic couplers for this avionics application.

The technology will make systems formerly requiring hazardous explosives not only safer and more energetic but also less environmentally disruptive and lower in cost. Analysis shows that Metafex energy densities are more than twice as great as those of conventional explosives. Because the energy density is greater, weapon components can be made smaller and/or more effective, yet safer, if they use Metafex in place of explosives. There are many US Navy applications, including linear shaped charges (LSC's) for salvage and obstacle clearance operations. By replacing the high explosive with Metafex, LSC's will be safer. Because they will be safer, they will be less costly to manufacture, to ship, and to use. Also, disposal of obsolete ordnance will be non-hazardous. In contrast to conventional ones, the proposed LSC's require no explosives. They are environmentally benign, can be safely shipped anywhere; and need no special handling.

The implication is that signal detection and classification must now be performed on the time series outputs of a large number of beams. Current and planned buoy to aircraft communications channels cannot accomodate this increased load. Current multiple beam sensors (ADAR) address this by reduced frequency band coverage relative to the former DIFAR full band. Even with this reduced coverage, which may cause signals of interest (SOI) to be missed, transmitting raw acoustic data from all beams and sensors would overwhelm the operators. This effort addresses the problem by defining innovative system-level concepts and algorithms for autonomous in-buoy detection and contact processing of the beam time series such that only critical target information is transmitted to the monitoring aircraft. A goal will be to restore the full band of acoustic signal processing while minimizing power consumption.

In the SSM, a simple micro-spacecraft derived vehicle is employed which could cheaply investigate multiple targets and simultaneously demonstrate the utility of small solar sails. The SSM reduces technology risk by using off-the-shelf aluminized mylar. A very small core vehicle with short range communication systems drastically reduces the size of the sails, allowing the spacecraft to be launched as a hitchhiker payload.  Because the spacecraft is small, the sail is small, allowing it to be self-deployed using either a rolled spring-steel or inflatable self-deploying boom system. Because of its maneuverability, the SSM could visit multiple targets, engaging in photographic inspection of friendly or adversarial satellites. A SSM could be used to disable or destroy other satellites by parking itself in a position where it blocked the target spacecraft's solar arrays. It could also be used to interfere with the operation of an opponent's remote sensing vehicle by using its sails to block the view.

Verifying that the participant is in fact the student being certified and not a  stand in , for whatever reason, and that this person is authorized to access the training data is important for many reasons. The use of Smart Cards, represents the latest technology to be used in the commercial world, for control and access to confidential data, such as for Internet commerce or retention of personal medical data. Smart Cards are  credit card  like devices, which utilize an embedded memory chip (rather than older technologies such as magnetic stripe cards). The chief advantage of the Smart Card is that it can support multiple functions and may even include Java  Cardlets . The use of Smart Card technology is being adopted rapidly by the DoD in many areas. The Department of the Navy is one of the leaders in the adoption of Smart Cards for DoD use. Several initiatives have been launched to date, which potentially will put Smart Cards in the hands of all Navy personnel. These developments will include the use of  Smart Dog Tags  which allow the storage of a sailor's complete military record as well as emergency medical data, to be carried with them at all times, and potential inclusion into the Smart Ship program to support the overall reduction of crews. Adapting these cards, to be used as the access keys for distance learning and distributed training exercises is a natural addition of the use of Smart Cards to the Navy's Smart Card program and will help with the integration of training system technology into the  smart base  program and for shipboard training programs.

Accordingly, there is a desire to develop a transducer and/or actuator that capitalizes on these properties.

The design is based on U. S. Patent 4,845,688 and uses stiff lever arms to magnify the displacement without significant bending, which can reduce the coupling coefficient.

This is primarily due to the fact that the spatial characteristics of the radar returns depend on two cone angles, rather than one for the linear array. This increases the clutter rank and also introduces range de-pendence to the covariance matrix of clutter at a particular Doppler frequency. Thus, when covariance estimation is performed through range averaging, an error exists that affects the STAP performance. The challenges become greater when one includes effects such as aircraft interference and mutual coupling. The proposed research will provide greater insight as to how the differences between radar returns in cir-cular arrays and linear arrays impact the various components of STAP algorithms. Novel adaptive signal processing approaches that overcome the challenges present in the circular array problem will be investi- gated. These techniques will lead to STAP algorithms that provide both enhanced mitigation of clutter and ECM, and enhanced target detectability over conventional STAP approaches. Three basic compo-nents of STAP processing will be investigated: 1) Pre- processing techniques, 2) Covariance matrix esti-mation and 3) Weight formation.

Removing the slope efficiency limitation means it is now important to ask what slope efficiency limitation means it is now important to ask what slope efficiency is the most desirable from a cost and performance perspective.  To establish a basis for commercialization of this approach, Photonic Systems proposes a Phase I program composed of four major parts: 1. Analyze the design tradeoffs among cascade laser, link and pre-amplifier parameters; 2. Select a specific configuration and fabricate a small cascade array; 3. Assemble and test a link using the cascade laser; and 4. Design, fabricate and test a low cost ($100) link with better performance that is available today.

While vehicle concepts abound, they all face a common problem; very low-speed flight requires proportionately more power than higher speed flight.  This creates a need for a small, light weight, high energy density power supply.  One way to achieve the needed energy density is to build the power supply function into another part of the vehicle through the use of multifunctional structures.  This can be done by fabricating wings with monopolar fuel cells as their external surfaces, serving as both wing surface and power supply.  This produces only a minimal increase in drag, and forward motion supplies air, with only 50 cm2 of cell area required to supply 5 watts of power.  The internal portion of the wing serves as the fuel tank, with the fuel cell stack as one surface.  Further weight reductions can be achieved by using the metal current collectors within the fuel cells as antennas.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"SIENNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"High Thermal Conductivity Vacuum-Compatible Microwave Absorbers","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306490","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"SIENNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Novel Flux Growth Technology for Growing Aluminum Nitride Single Crystals","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306494","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"SIENNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306710","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Special Operations Command","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"SIERRA MONOLITHICS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Endothermic/ Exothermic Composites for Thermal Management","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306742","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"Sierra Nevada Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306930","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Defense Threat Reduction Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"SIGMA TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306936","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"SIGMA TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Ultra-High Energy Density Polymer Film Capacitors","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/306942","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"SIGMA TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Information Extraction from Text Through Learning and Visualization","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/307047","abstract":"Not Available  Lightweight ceramic composites that exhibit high strengths and high toughnesses even at elevated temperatures are of particular interest for ballistic missiles, advanced gas turbine engines, unmanned combat aero vehicles, and other structural applications.

However, the low corrosion resistance and inadequate high temperature creep resistance, make SiC(f)-toughened glass matrix composites unsuitable for many structural applications. LoTEC, therefore, proposes the development and commercialization of SiC(fiber)- reinforced high temperature structural composites involving fully crystalline, sodium zirconium phosphate (NZP) matrices.

Plasma-sprayed coatings can have unique properties that are far superior to conventional coatings (paint, plating, etc.) in terms of wear and corrosion resistance. The plasma-sprayed coating would either entirely replace or be used in conjunction with more conventional paint-like coatings to achieve the desired color. The roughness of the plasma-sprayed coating would be controlled to provide the desired non-skid characteristics. The adhesion of the paint-like coating, if used, would be highly enhanced by the roughness and high corrosion resistance of the plasma-sprayed coating. Plasma spraying offers many advantages over other techniques for applying coatings, because it is inherently inexpensive, environmentally benign, easily scaled to production scenarios, and features high, easily controllable deposition rates.

This investigation found that turbulent loads are the driving factor in the design of these vehicles.  In particular, two-or three dimensional turbulent motions give rise to higher loads that those from the maneuvering or one-dimensional gust loads used in classical aircraft design.  Existing turbulent loads analysis techniques and data were found to be inadequate when trying to estimate the design loads for such flexible and lightweight aircraft.  It was also found that almost no statistical turbulence data exists for aircraft that cruise for months at extreme altitudes and may experience only one or two takeoffs and landings during their design lifetime.  As a result, the current generation of aircraft may have been significantly over-designed to account for uncertainty in the expected turbulence loads.  Solar powered aircraft may have been significantly over-designed to account for uncertainty in the expected turbulence loads.  Solar powered aircraft performance depends very strongly on being able to reduce weight.  This document proposes to investigate the feasibility of a system that, through both an active control system for direct reduction of turbulence induced loads and, through the indirect development of a significant database of high altitude turbulence information, will lead to reduced structural weight and greatly improved performance for HALE UAVs.","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Development of Advanced Chemical Oxygen-Iodine Laser (COIL) Mixing Nozzles","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/318164","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"S T I OPTRONICS INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/318212","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Stress Technology, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/318226","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"STIEFVATER CONSULTANTS","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/318230","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"STIEFVATER CONSULTANTS","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Tracking Through Optical Turbulence","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/318354","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"STOCHASTECH CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Throttling Gel Bipropellant Engine","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/318425","abstract":"Not Available  As the naval aviation fleet continues to age, methods for accurately predicting the presence of structural flaws-- such as hidden corrosion-- that compromise airworthiness become increasingly necessary.

Our proposed work focuses on a variety of different tomographic reconstruction techniques to graphically represent the Lamb wave data in quantitative maps that can be easily interpreted by technicians. Because the velocity of Lamb waves depends on thickness, for example, we can convert the traveltimes of the fundamental Lamb modes into a thickness map of the inspection region.

Sensant Corp believes that recent improvements in transducer technology that now enable air-coupled inspection may overcome many of the traditional shortcomings of costly, time-consuming ultrasonic inspection systems for large areas. The recent application of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology to ultrasonic devices has created an advanced ultrasonic sensor with significantly improved dynamic range (110 db) and wide range of operating frequencies in air (2-12 MHz). These new ultrasonic transducers are fabricated in the same manner as a silicon chip using a technique known as micromachining. In many cases, these devices enable the possibility of air-coupled, non-contact inspection of materials as demonstrated by Sensant using aluminum and Plexiglas sheets. For this research, Sensant will characterize the acoustic properties of the multi-layer material to be inspected and will determine the required properties of an ultrasonic inspection system. Then, the company will develop a custom MEMS transducer to investigate the feasibility of ultrasonic inspection of multi-layer materials. To ensure rapid inspection of large areas, Sensant will evaluate both a longitudinal wave and lamb-wave approach using arrays of focused MEMS transducers.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"SY TECHNOLOGY, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Fast Infrared Imaging Polarimeter Development","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/322065","abstract":"Not Available  Crystal oscillators, whether simple clocks or precision frequency references, are used in almost every present-day electronic system, and this is expected to remain true for the foreseeable future. The success of numerous weapons systems now under active development depends upon electronics packages capable of withstanding very high acceleration and mechanical shock, most of which will also use crystal oscillators. Applications include guided munitions, smart fuzes, and penetrating weapons. For this program we are interested in the application to Extended Range Guided Munition (ERGM), which will incorporate on-board GPS receivers as part of the guidance system. The receiver requires a frequency source whose accuracy determines the time to acquire the first satellite. To meet the allowable thermally induced frequency shift this will be a TCXO - - a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator. Although the circuitry of a crystal oscillator is relatively shock inert, the conventional crystal resonators used are inherently susceptible to shock. To manufacture crystal oscillators shock-hardened up to 30,000 G there is a corresponding need for hardened resonators. PTI has been intimately involved over the past decade in the development of resonator shock-hardening technology. Each technique developed to date has certain limitations, different for each. By combining techniques we feel that inherent failure mechanisms can be eliminated. This first phase of this program will demonstrate that the combination of techniques which we have mastered, can produce a much more rugged but still economical resonator. In this program PTI will develop the solutions needed to meet the objectives of this solicitation in an economical manner.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"SY TECHNOLOGY, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Phase Tunable Spatial Light Modulator","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/322071","abstract":"Not Available  Traditional power electronics has evolved an ad-hoc packaging scheme.

Existing approaches to information systems security focus on component level vulnerabilities that are already known to exist.  What is needed is an approach that targets strategic vulnerabilities at a system-wide level.  In order that such an approach be applicable to attacks that may be devised in the future, adversaries need to be modeled in a relatively generic fashion.  Further, the approach should be capable of suggesting countermeasures and of providing the system security officer with a visualization of the tradeoffs.  The central contribution of the proposed work will be the development of a tool, called Mitigator, that will model adversary threats and suggest countermeasures to offset identified vulnerabilities.  It will help the system designer and security administrator to predict where red teams will attack the system and to handle the tradeoff between risk, performance, cost and functionality.  To provide these capabilities, we propose a market-based multi-agent approach based on time-tested game theoretic concepts from economics.

A weakly reflecting target appears as a distinctively shaped hole in surrounding volume clutter.  Chirp's rotation-invariant target classifier uses dolphin-like signals for mine discrimination.  Mines are also discriminated from other objects by using composite rough/smooth feature images that identify the relatively smooth outer case along with reflections of rough, granular explosive from inside the mine.  Chirp uses a semi-coherent, Doppler tolerant broadband tomographic imaging system that is easier to implement and is more robust than fully coherent SAS.  All signal processing functions are commensurate with animal sensory system capabilities.  Chrip's SAS is equivalent to back projection tomography (as in medical imaging) but is more general because it utilizes feature images and image-based tracking for motion compensation.

The integration of these two technologies is essential since both ballistic protection and containment of high pressure gases are simultaneously required for proper function of this component. The desired result of an overmatch threat engagement is to contain the stowed munition by preventing ejection from the container, while at the same time venting any gases to the exterior of the vehicle.

Sensor structures created from very thin films have low lateral sensitivity, and lack structural rigidity perpendicular to the substrate.

Major limitations of current thin film MEMS fabrication processes are: limited inertial mass and cross-sectional area, fixed and constant layer thicknesses, limited flexibility for vertical actuation mechanisms, in-situ vacuum encapsulation, and choice of layer materials.  It is the goal of the proposed research to develop a thick-film fabrication process analogous to commercially available thin-film processes, such as MCNC's MUMPS process or Sandia's SUMMiT process.

In most battlefield scenarios, it is valuable to be able to assess the area of operation prior to deployment of troops.  Video sensors deployed in the field provide valuable visual information that can be used to develop strategies prior to sending in troops.  A major limitation of existing video sensors is field of view.  It is highly desirable to have sensors that provide  complete  coverage after deployment.  From this perspective, omni-directional video cameras present major advantages over conventional ones.  The 360 degree coverage provided by such a sensor enables a remote user to  look around  and assess the battlefield.  Today, the main drawback of omni-directional cameras  is their limited resolution.  Since a complete hemispherical fields is projected onto a single CCD detector, far away objects are only imaged onto a small numbers of pixels.  For instance, when a standard NTSC video camera is used in conjunction with omni-directional imaging optics, a human 50 meters away will appear within just 5-10 pixels in a typical omni-directional image.  This proposal is geared towards the development of high-resolution omni-directional cameras.  The implementation of such sensors requires not only the use of a high-definition video camera but also the design and fabrication of accompanying optics to generate the desired field of view.  Our optical design will be a catadioptric one, where mirrors are used in conjunction with lenses to project the large field of view onto a single planar image detector.  This design procedure will require the use of sophisticated optical design techniques.  In addition to the design of a high-definition omni-directional sensor, we propose the implementation of a series of low-level image processing and image understanding algorithms.  These algorithms will include real-time generation of perspective video, real-time tracking and monitoring of multiple moving objects, fast ego-motion estimation for applications where the omni-directional sensor is mounted on a moving platform, as well as higher-level algorithms for activity and object recognition.","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"US NANOCORP, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Geotextile Waste Filteration Unit Concept","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/343071","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"UTD, INC.","reseach institution":"Catholic University of America"},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/343131","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"Utility Development Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/343294","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1999,"firm":"UTRON, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Very High-Performance Advanced Filter Bank Analog-to-Digital Converter (AFB ADC)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/343384","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"V CORP.

Modularization of a complex circuit into smaller blocks, fabricated on separate chips and mounted on a common carrier, circumvents this limitation and improves reliability.

In Phase I, 20 Gb/s data transfer through non-superconducting solder bumps and passive transmission lines on the MCM carrier will be demonstrated, using digital logic to eliminate the need for amplification and avoid bandwidth limitations of transmission lines. In Phase II, HYPRES will increase this interconnect speed to 30 Gb/s and use this novel MCM technology to develop digital receiver components.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"VASA ASSOC., INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"INS based on distributed accelerometers in combination with small-size and low-cost gyroscopes","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/344544","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1999,"firm":"VENIS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"An Efficient Object-Oriented System for Extracting Terrain Features from Contour Maps","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/345403","abstract":"Not Available  Advanced Cerametrics, Inc.

They are also quite expensive.  A low cost noise laser is urgently needed for the antenna remoting and other applications for military as well as for commercial users.

Researchers have already demonstrated low noise lasers with noise of -165 dBc/Hz in the 1-20GHz range and it appears that better noise level can be achieved.  However, currently they are extremely expensive to manufacture.  The new technology of high power VCSELs which can be used as pump lasers will drastically change the picture by making it possible to manufacture ultra low noise solid state lasers at very low cost.

Moreover, the displays are not very flexible.  Work has been done to produce better conducting thin films (such as indium-tin-oxice) that are transparent but higher conductivity is needed and these films tend to be very brittle.

These materials can be readily combined with state of the art polymer processing techniques to provide a viable method for producing the thin, flexible, optically transparent conducting sheets required for both military and commercial display systems.

A method based on the Feynman diagram model is described that permits discrimination between multiply scattered field data and data arising fro discrete scatterers such as mines.  The limited backscatter data associated with discrete but multiply scattering objects is then processed using a nonlinear filter to remove multiple scattering effects.  The resulting poorly resolved estimate for each discrete object is further processed using our spectral estimation technique, the Prior Discrete Fourier Transform (PDFT).  This technique requires that some prior knowledge about the targets, i.e. size, approximate shape. Using this PDFT information allows discrimination between targets based on a simple calculation of the magnitude of the coefficients of the PDFT estimate derived from each possible choice of prior knowledge.

Existing communication methods will be severely stressed by the requirements of such an environment: Propagation anomalies such as multipath fading and interference will require intensive digital processing to mitigate their effects.  By developing a digital signaling approach based on the control of the natural complexity of the chaotic behavior of RF devices, alternative solutions to these fundamental problems emerge.  We will develop in this proposal an approach for controlling an RF chaotic oscillator that preserves the natural properties of the waveform while encoding digital information at the highest rate possible.  We call this approach dynamics-based signaling, and it is based on the fundamental connection between dynamics and communication theory and symbolic dynamics.  We will also investigate frequency scaling, and the advantages of this approach over traditional methods for digital communication.

A series of such pulses with repetition rates of several hundred hertz lowers the sensitivity of protection circuits by up to two orders of magnitude.  We propose to use microwaves as a carrier frequency with video modulation.  Microwave radiation can be formed as a narrow wave beam that sufficiently increases the power flow on the target, consequently increasing the processes of rectification in the irradiated radioelectronic elements.  This combination of using a narrow directed wave beam with pulses of duration of about 10 ns will generate an effective tool for far distance disabling of electronic circuits.  A mobile device using a high-power L-band vircator already exists and operates in the single pulse regime.  However, the vircator cannot operate as a HPM generator of high rate repetition pulses because of the position of electrodes in the interaction space.  The proposed development of HPM X-band sources which are capable of operating at a high repetition rate, with bursts of short pulses and in automodulation regimes, will permit us to build a far distance HPM disabling device consisting of a system of focusing the wave beam and a high current electron gun able to operated at high repetition rate pulses.
