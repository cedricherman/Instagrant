[{"title":"Balloon Latitude Trajectory Control System","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/171559","abstract":"Global Aerospace Corporation is proposing to develop a totally new concept for latitude trajectory control system (TCS) for NASA s Ultra Long Duration (ULDB) Balloons. The advantages of the TCS concept are that it uses little power, operates at night, is lightweight, does not require detailed knowledge of the wind field, and allows the balloon to fly at a constant altitude. The TCS enables the balloon to avoid populous areas and hazards to payload recovery, reach desirable targets, steer around no-fly zones and select convenient landing sites. Currently, when a balloon deviates significantly from a desired flight path, cut down often occurs, sometimes before mission objectives have been met. With a TCS, fewer flights will be terminated early. Furthermore, it will be easier to obtain permission to launch since the planned flight path can be achieved in a greater range of conditions. No longer will balloons be at the mercy of the winds.","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"Global Aerospace Corporation ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"ULTRA HIGH RESOLUTION SQUID MAGNETOMETERS FOR BIOLOGICAL","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/184618","abstract":"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The objective of the proposed research is to develop ultra-high resolution, thin film low-temperature superconductivity (LTS) SQUID magnetometers (UHRSM) with integrated pickup-loops. The UHRSM will be optimized for imaging of the magnetic fields produced by action currents, injury and developmental currents, remanent magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility in isolated living tissue and small experimental animal preparations. During Phase I, the applicants innovation in SQUID design and fabrication already produced a reliable, simple to operate, inexpensive SQUID sensor with integrated pick-up coils, whose flux noise was comparable to the best commercially available SQUID sensors. The integration of the SQUID sensor into a cryogenic system resulted in a prototype instrument currently incorporated into an active research program at Vanderbilt University. Their present design allows a window-to-SQUID spacing of less than 20mm. The prototype proposed to be developed under the Phase II project will be an inexpensive, modular, customizable, bench-top LTS SQUID instrument for biological research with spatial resolution below 100mm and field sensitivities on the order of 1pT/(square root Hz). The proposed instrument will be capable of making measurements that are impossible with any other electric or magnetic instrument, and should lead to new insights into cellular biology and electro- and magnetophysiology. The existing expertise will be exploited further to develop and improve SQUID sensors for general and custom biomagnetic applications which require higher-sensitivity SQUID magnetometers and gradiometers but lower spatial resolution. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The cryogenic technology, the expertise in SQUID design, and they STTR grant would allow us to target SQUID microscopes with spatial resolutions below 100 microm with sensitivities around 1 pT/Hz-1/2. The LTS SQUIDs enables new measurements with a higher bandwidth, a higher spatial resolution and a much faster scanning rate due to a superior signal to noise ratio. The market for such an instrument is not enormous, but we are convinced to sell 5-10 systems mainly used in research per year. However, should the instrument be widely accepted, for example, as quality control instrument in the immunodiagnostic industry or as instrument to perform NDE on electronic components, we could sell tens of systems per year.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"HYPRES, INC.","reseach institution":"Vanderbilt University"},{"title":"A Lightweight Modular Solar Array Subsystem for ULDB Missions","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/171555","abstract":"The NASA Ultra-Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) program will extend the capabilities of the existing high-altitude scientific balloon program.

Available DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal exposure to alcohol is the leading causing of birth defects in the United States. Recent studies show prevalence rates in the US may be as high as 1% of live births (Burd L, Cotsonas-Hassler, et al., 2003). This means that each year, as many as 39,000 babies are born with FAS. Many more are born with fetal alcohol effects (FAE). Early diagnosis and appropriate management has repeatedly been shown to significantly reduce the risk of secondary disabilities and increase positive outcomes (Streissguth et al. 1997). AEI is developing a set of multimedia and web components about FAS that target lay care providers, particularly foster and adoptive parents. The project seeks to increase early and accurate diagnosis of children exposed to alcohol prenatally and to facilitate appropriate treatment and ongoing management of those affected by the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and its associated disorders. \nPhase I resoundingly met its technical and evaluative tests of feasibility, going well beyond the originally envisioned deliverables. Phase I produced a commercial quality CD-ROM that focused on helping lay care providers recognize problems and seek diagnosis. This CD-ROM was examined in a randomized, controlled field trial and was found to increase subject knowledge of FAS significantly more than the comparison condition. The program was also considered by subjects to be better than the comparison condition on measures of usefulness, effect on confidence, and usability. The program surpassed the experimentally postulated values for all usability measures. Qualitative feedback further supported success of the project. The Phase I FAS Multimedia Guide and the results of the evaluation strongly support continuance to Phase II. Phase II of the project will continue this effort by (1) creating a significant new module on treatment and management, (2) revising and extending the Phase I module, (3) enhancing and extending the Phase I web site, (4) creating VMS and DVD versions for wider distribution of the core materials. Evaluation will be conducted through (1) subject matter expert reviews, (2) end-user focus groups, and (3) a quasi-experimental field trial, and (4) commercializing the products from Phases I and II through parent associations, distributors, and state agencies.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ACADEMIC EDGE, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/68413","abstract":"Not Available  This SBIR Phase I Research Proposal seeks to develop a new phenomena, high pressure electrokinetic (HPEK)pumping, for the development of high force, compact, and low power consumption actuators suitable for a variety of aerospace applications.

The instrument's configuration allows flexibility in sample preparation-large samples as well as microsamples can be used without special preparation.","agency":["Environmental Protection Agency"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/80087","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AEROGAGE CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81074","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AFFYMETRIX","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81331","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Agbio Development, Inc.","reseach institution":"Argonne National Laboratory"},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81351","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AGENNIX, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/82071","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AgraSol, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/82107","abstract":"Not Available  A zenith viewing spectroradiometer aircraft instrument is proposed for tropospheric profile measurements of O3, NO2, and SO2, aerosol optical depths and UV spectral radiances from differential column amounts measured as functions of aircraft altitude.

This system will exclude animals from areas, or contain them within defined boundaries, where it is impractical or inefficient to build fence to achieve this objective. These needs arise in a variety of contexts, including the exclusion of livestock from riparian and other environmentally sensitive areas and the relocation of animals in managed intensive grazing. The Phase I research project conducted by AgriTech explored and confirmed the feasibility of a GPS-based system that would achieve these objectives. In the proposed Phase II project, the system will be redesigned and improved to (1) reduce the size of the ear tag units; (2) improve the accuracy of the system by Differential GPS (DGPS); and (3) reduce power consumption for increased battery life. The Phase II project will also include research on key animal behavior issues, including (1) improving response to audible stimulation; (2) further analyzing response to electric shock stimulation; (3) exploring herd behavior implications of the system; and (4) investigating consistency of animal response and learning behavior.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"AgriTech Electronics, L.C.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/82202","abstract":"Not Available Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a multi-perspective 360 degree look-around integral 3-D projection display that will enable air traffic control crews to view and analyze all aircraft activity in the airspace simultaneously, without w","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AgriTech Electronics, L.C.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/82204","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"AgriTech Electronics, L.C.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/82210","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AGRI-TECH, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/82226","abstract":"Not Available  Quality Research Associates proposes developing a software tool to automatically generate interface code that integrates user applications with object-oriented (OO) modules from a library of software fault tolerance techniques.

Texas A&M University (TAMU) has tested a lime pretreatment process that is effective and low-cost. A significant element of the pretreatment cost is the lime regeneration system. To reduce costs, Altex has identified the Low Cost Lime Regenerator (LCLR). The LCLR is more compact, less costly and more efficient than conventional regeneration systems. Based on equipment supplier inputs, the LCLR can reduce lime regeneration costs by 55 percent. Under the Phase II program, TAMU and Altex will work together to demonstrate the lime pretreatment and LCLR lime regeneration concepts in a 2 TPD test system. Also, with input from equipment suppliers, full-scale system designs and capital and operating costs will be refined. System performance and costs will then be compared to those for conventional systems. This will show the benefits of the biomass lime pretreatment and LCLR approaches over existing method.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"Altex Technologies Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/86191","abstract":"Not Available The Mars Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Freezer (MACDOF) is a low cost and low power refrigerating device that will condense carbon dioxide directly from the Martian atmosphere.

An additional improvement proposed is one that overlays the live video signals with graphics that are extracted from the observed scene.

The objective of such a tool is to provide a generic, flexible and user-friendly platform for developing species-specific models that allow planners and managers to explore the viability of an endangered species under alternative forest management and conservation options. The proposed software tool will combine a landscape model that predicts changes in the structure of a species' habitat, with a spatially structured, stochastic metapopulation model that estimates the extinction risk of the species. Such a tool will enable more realistic evaluation of the conservation practices and management options, such as schedule and type of timber harvest, design of nature reserves, reintroductions and translocations. It will also enable more accurate assessment of the impact of human activities (such as forestry practices, road building, agricultural expansion, and dam construction) on the fate of endangered and threatened species. The research will involve developing, integrating and testing algorithms for producing, exporting and interpreting habitat maps and for building models for species which live in multiple patches that change through time, such as in fragmented habitats.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"Applied Biomathematics Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/91964","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"Applied Biomathematics Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/91966","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Applied Biomathematics Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/91968","abstract":"Not Available In-flight calibration of optical instrumentation on spaceborne platforms is essential to provide accurate Earth Resources/Energy Budget trends.

It is the subject of four issued U.S. patents. The protein is 500 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose and has the functional characteristics, such as taste and stability, required to be a leading commercial sweetener. Expression of the Brazzein gene in maize should yield the equivalent \u00bf ton of sugar per ton of maize, providing the basis for a range of economical high and low intensity sweeteners with benefits to agriculture, the food industry and the consumer. ProdiGene has the technical capability to develop commercial maize varieties for the production of the Brazzein sweetener. Commercial success requires the achievement of relatively high levels of Brazzein expression in maize. Research conducted during Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of maize for Brazzein production, resulting in levels of Brazzein in excess of 0.8% of total soluble protein. Phase II research will seek to enhance these levels using a variety of promoters, targeting signals and gene modifications. In addition, process technology will be developed and evaluated to mill, extract and purify Brazzein from maize, and purified Brazzein will be used in taste tests to determine the most suitable formulations for commercial applications.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"Applied Biotechnology Institute, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/92242","abstract":"Not Available  We propose to develop multi-channel silicon x-ray detector arrays, and their associated integrated circuit pulse-processing electronics, for high energy resolution remote x-ray fluorescence measurements for planetary geochemical analysis.

Through a collaborative process, the Universal Trail Assessment Process (UTAP) was developed to provide access information to trail users. Trail managers use the process to determine compliance with accessibility design guidelines. UTAP trainings are limited, particularly in rural areas, by the small number of UTAP Trainers. This research project will develop a training program to create a large, geographically diverse pool of UTAP Trainers. An increase in UTAP Trainers will ensure that more land management agencies, like the USDA Forest Service, will have the opportunity to use the UTAP. Phase I began the process of developing training materials through the establishment of a Project Advisory Board, drafting materials for Train-the-Trainer workshops, identifying training candidates, and developing a preliminary national implementation strategy. Phase II will refine the training materials and evaluate their effectiveness, and finalize the national implementation plan. Widespread availability of the UTAP will enhance access for all Americans, including people with disabilities, parents with young children, older adults, and inexperienced hikers, by enabling individuals to make informed decisions about trails appropriate for their interests and abilities.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"BENEFICIAL DESIGNS INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/105944","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"BENEFICIAL DESIGNS INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/105946","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"BENEFICIAL DESIGNS INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/105950","abstract":"Not Available All NASA Enterprises possesses large, complex databases.

Figure 1 is an schematic representation of a 36\" diameter NS3D woven wheel with an axial interface, showing clearly the radial fiber arrangement","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ELECTROSONICS MEDICAL INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/108455","abstract":"Not Available  Designing 21st century civil and military aircraft for minimum development and life cycle costs, and maximum performance requires aerodynamic models for a new generation of preliminary design tools.

The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to \"gate\" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.  \n  \nTime-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation). FDA-sanctioned clinical trials will be conducted in the third year, leading to submission of an application for a 510(k) clearance.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/116711","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CAMBRIDGE SCIENTIFIC, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/116713","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CAMBRIDGE SCIENTIFIC, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/116715","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CAMBRIDGE SCIENTIFIC, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/116853","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CANCER GENETICS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/116938","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CANDELA CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/117256","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Cape Cod Research","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/117579","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CARBOMER, INC.","reseach institution":"Tufts University"},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/117581","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CARBOMER, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/117601","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Carbon Solutions, Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/117671","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"CARCINEX, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/117689","abstract":"Not Available The design and fabrication of novel power transistors and electrical converters for cryogenic operation is proposed.

Phase I research demonstrated ability to upgrade 18% protein midds to 47% protein concentrate, in part, by hydrolyzing hemicellulose to pentose for high protein yeast propagation, instead of leaving it as an inexpensive source of fiber. In the U.S. 224 flour mills produce 5.13 million tons of midds annually, which, if processed, represent $1.1 billion in sales and $190 million net income potential. The price of midds would rise. A $20/ton increase translates to $.10/bushel, or nearly $235 million more value for American wheat. Equally important are prospects that such processing could be a pretreatment ?bridge' to more economical cellulosic biomass-to-ethanol processing. Recovering a significant co-product feed credit greatly improves biomass potential. Wheat screenings could also be processed, helping improve wheat quality and value. Research in Phase II focuses on a prototype plant large enough to provide product samples for feed trials necessary to support commercial expansion of the bioprocess. The prototype plant will also establish operational costs for determining profit potential in commercial plants.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"Harvest Fuel, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/179588","abstract":"Not Available  Physical Sciences Inc.

Availability of this type of equipment is primarily required in very small Earth orbiting satellites. Such transponders transmit and receive commands and data to and from Earth, or in certain situations from or between other satellites. Development of a transponder such as this is considered innovative due to the lack of any known commercial source for space qualified telemetry equipment that can fulfill this need with the attributes required for very small Earth orbiting satellites. These include a high scale of integration, a very low mass and volume, a high level of power efficiency, and the ability to operate from low voltage supplies of 3 to 7 VDC.","agency":["Department of

make potential revolutionary Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) designs possible. However, their inability to sustain and operate through transients is limited. Since bearing reliability, size and weight are crucial in space based FESS, a durable, compact high-speed touchdown bearing is needed. A lightweight Zero Clearance Auxiliary Bearing (ZCAB) suitable for high-speed operation is proposed to meet this need. MiTi has already demonstrated a ZCAB at speeds to 10,000 rpm under 14-g shock loads and simulated AMB failure. Under this program MiTi will 1) establish a preliminary design of a light-weight, high-speed ZCAB suitable for vacuum operation; 2) select the key materials and lubricants for the ZCAB; 3) Establish the Phase II preliminary test rig designs to qualify the ZCAB at high speed; and 4) Prepare a final report.","agency":["Environmental Protection Agency"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase

proposes an advanced vortex combustion ramjet (VCRJ) featuring an innovative, vortex-flow, wall surface burning combustor, having improved combustion efficiency with cleaner burning and an extended operating range. Full-wall, liquid-fuel injection is expected to permit wide throttling without flame holders because the combustion is anchored at the wall as in a hybrid rocket engine. ORBITEC has been developing a similar device as a hybrid rocket engine with solid fuel walls. The unique co-axial vortex promotes combustion, with an extended flow path and thorough mixing. Benefits include: simplicity, low cost, and improved combustion to provide enhanced performance, with extended range and flight ceiling for the vehicle. In Phase I, a small prototype ramjet will be designed, built and tested. In Phase II, a larger engine will be flown in an RPV. NASA applications may include a research RPV, providing design and operational data for SST propulsion. Early commercial applications include RPV s to be used in forest fire surveillance, traffic and accident viewing, search and rescue and weather observations, government use may include RPV s for border surveillance, cruise weapon systems, target drones, and forward observation aircraft. These uses also support continued development of the engine cycle for SST applications, including fractional orbit vehicles.

Plant supports of interest include seed plugs, seeding mats, root/shoot barriers, and plant fences. The innovation is to develop totally regenerable plant structures that retain sufficient structural integrity for plant support over one crop cycle, that can be fabricated on-site, are non-toxic to plants, and which do not require separation from the inedible plant waste stream. By forming expendable components from inedible plant material already in the ALS system, resupply mass can be significantly reduced (an annual supply of non-regenerable seed plugs is about 124 to 3000 kg depending on the type). Harvesting procedures would be simplified since support structures would be processed directly as part of the inedible waste stream. The use of regenerable seed plugs would also reduce crew time, and simplify the mechanization of seeding and harvesting processes. Proposal tasks involve processing plant fibers, fabrication of prototypes, and mechanical and biocompatibility testing of the prototype regenerable seed plugs. The anticipated result of this project is a process and associated technology to produce regenerable plant supports meeting ALS operational requirements.","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Orbital Technologies Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Aerodynamic Fluid Physics Research Facility (AFPRF)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/259406","abstract":"ORBITEC proposes to conduct innovative research and development that would culminate in an Aerodynamic Fluid Physics Research Facility (AFPRF) technology demonstration on the International Space Station serving one or more critical experimental needs of the NASA mg Program. The AFPRF would serve as an innovative microgravity apparatus that would virtually eliminate g-jitter and provide a gently controlled acceleration environment. The innovation is based on: the use of a new type of gas-flow generator, an expert system software architecture concept, a non-contact approach for on-orbit position control of spherical liquid samples, and a non-contact fluid motion exciter. Prescribed acceleration levels can be accurately introduced through controlled pulses/oscillations or spin/rotation/vibration of the large and small floating fluid samples. We propose to develop a prototype flight unit to be tested on a reduced-gravity parabolic aircraft in Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop a space-qualifiable AFPRF system that can be used on the International Space Station to satisfy current and future fluid physics flight experiments. The AFPRF would become a powerful research tool with a very low-g, vibrationally isolated, float zone capability combined with a controllable acceleration and disturbance levels that would enhance future fluid physics experiments.","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Orbital Technologies Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/259695","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ORCCA TECHNOLOGY, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/259720","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ORCHID BIOSCIENCES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/259778","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ORDER STATUS VEHICLE, INC.

The potential candidate materials will further be evaluated as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Cathodes and anodes will be prepared by using a well-established electrodes fabrication technique. The reversible capacity of the modified LiMxMn2-xO4 will be evaluated by developing half-cells with metallic lithium as the counter electrode.

Agricultural chemicals are a major source of pollution of surface water and aquifers rendering water supplies in many agricultural areas unsuitable for human consumption. The presence of nitrates and other contaminants in drinking water is a major health concern throughout the world, and agriculture is one of the largest contributors to this problem. In the Phase I program we developed a new class of materials that demonstrated rapid sorption kinetics, high capacity, and favorable selectivity for nitrates. A preliminary economic analysis indicated that the proposed process can significantly reduce the cost of water treatment, and will be applicable to numerous other separation technologies. All Phase I goals were met. The focus of this Phase II program is to 1) continue development and optimization of the new separation media; 2) design, fabrication and laboratory testing of prototype systems; 3) field-test of prototype system; and 4) an economic and engineering analysis of the process. The goal of the Phase II program is to bring the technology to the point where it can be commercialized. Based on the Phase I results, we have already attracted interest from sector firms that are interested in pursuing its final scale-up and commercialization.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"ReyTech Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/293057","abstract":"Not Available Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop an analog phase-only diffractive liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LC-SLM) based on photo-alignment modulation (PAM) of liquid crystal phase.

The OFQS is non-intrusive and capable of instantaneous indication of the presence of two phase flow. In addition, the fully developed sensor will be capable of determining relative concentrations of several different fluids and/or gases which may be present.

The new FGD material resulted in significantly more groundcover yield than commercial agricultural lime when applied at equivalent rates and resulted in plants with significantly greater rooting. In Phase II, these encouraging greenhouse results will be scaled up to field tests. Because the results were so positive, agricultural mini-plot field-tests will also be performed on quality farmland, in addition to reclamation trails at an actual abandoned mine site. The reclamation site trials will examine the possibility of lowering topsoil requirements by using the new FGD material.

Available Accurately gauging liquid quantity in tanks in low and zero gravity proves difficult because surface tension forces migrate vapor roughly to tank center and away from any solid probes. Small accelerations also cause slosh states which frustrate static measurements. Gauging systems on spacecraft must also handle cryogens accurately (and not, for example, add any significant heat to cryotanks). Foster-Miller proposes to combine its patented Dynamical Instruments nonlinear analysis with an acoustic or radio frequency resonant mode sensor. Existing efforts have correlated liquid volume roughly with resonant frequency. Unfortunately, slosh states and varying vapor-liquid orientations prevent conventional linear signal analysis from attaining useful accuracies.

The cooler employs a pulse tube cold head and a thermo-compressor, eliminating the weight, expense, and reliability burden of the compressor drive motor and the power electronics. In Phase I, we will experimentally demonstrate auto-resonant operation of a thermo-compressor displacer and design an engineering model cryocooler system. The key outcome of this effort will be confirmation that the Phase II cooler can operate successfully with minimal electronics. In Phase II, we will fabricate a complete cryocooler system, perform laboratory testing, and document performance characteristics.","agency":["Department of Health and Human

However, for specialized tasks, such as optimal process control, current software tools require a dedicated software engineer to implement downloadable code for efficient, real-time processing.  In this Phase I STTR, Quadrant Engineering proposes the development of a high level software environment to implement a variety of process control algorithms that can be used by engineers or technicians without specialized software or control theory training.  Working with specialist in controls from the University of Massachusetts, we plan to evaluate methods for implementing sophisticated control systems using commercially available VXI hardware and software tools.  The user interface, running under Windows 95, will allow non-expert users to define control tasks using a variety of approaches, including conventional open and closed loop control, Kalman filter, fuzzy logic and neural network algorithms.  During Phase I we will implement a demonstration system, including multi-channel data acquisition with multiple output channels, and loop control running in real-time on one or more dedicated processors.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AGAVE BIOSYSTEMS INC.","reseach institution":"CORNELL UNIV."},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81169","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"AGAVE BIOSYSTEMS INC.","reseach institution":"CORNELL UNIV."},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81420","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"AGENTASE LLC","reseach institution":"UNIV.

We propose to develop and test intelligent coaching strategies based on context-sensitive models of C2 decision making, and to test them in a dynamic C2 team simulation. Our approach blends formal decision models with intuitive explanations of model results and recommendations, using natural language that is meaningful to both experts and non-experts within a domain as well a graphical representations. We will focus on the decisions made by individuals acting as part of a command and control team.  Our proposed test environment for intelligent coaching concepts is a well-developed and tested multi-user simulation package--the Distributed Dynamic Decisionmaking (DDD) C2 team simulation. At the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate an agent-based coach integrated into the DDD environment and provide model-driven quantitative measures of performance. In Phase II, we will build on the results of Phase I to conduct quantitative tests of decision aid effectiveness in the DDD environment, and implement the decision aid concepts that have proved to be most successful in the DDD for demonstration and quantitative testing in higher fidelity simulations or real-world environments.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Luna Innovations Incorporated","reseach institution":"UNIV.

furnace for use in space. Vacuum and radiation insulation provide a means to almost eliminate heat losses from the furnace, allowing high temperatures to be achieved using low power. A cylindrical configuration provides strength, access, simplicity, and low mass. Vacuum pumping requirements are minimized by using the partial vacuum of space. Temperatures in excess of 1200oC can be achieved using less than 1 kW of power. Direct optical access will be included in the furnace design. The furnace has the potential to be a centerpiece for research and development of materials processing in space.

Over the past four years, BioTex has developed the Visualase(r) thermal therapy system for treatment of localized cancers by using temperature-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to precisely control the delivery of laser energy and the extent of tissue destruction.  \nThe current primary target applications for this system are small focal secondary or metastatic tumors in the brain and localized cancer in the prostate. Secondary applications include treatment of metastatic lesions in vertebral bodies, and unresectable liver tumors. Approximately 40,900 primary brain tumors and over 100,000 metastatic brain tumors will be diagnosed this year in the U.S. Additionally, 190,000 American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and over 30,000 will die from the disease. Of the 1.3 million patients who will be diagnosed with cancer this year (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), approximately 5-10% will develop problematic secondary metastatic tumors in the spine which will require intervention.  \nIn the first year of the proposed study, we will engage in pre-clinical studies and administrative activities required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an investigative device exemption (IDE). In the second and third years, we will conduct a Phase I clinical trial to explore the safety and utility of the Visualase system for treatment of patients will small focal metastatic brain tumors, particularly those which are deep-seated or otherwise inoperable. At the end of this study, we will have explored the clinical feasibility and safety of intracerebral laser therapy for treatment of small focal metastatic lesions, and we will have advanced the Visualase system and components to a feature and production level appropriate for 510(k) pre-market approval. This combination of stereotactic laser thermal therapy with real-time MRI will facilitate an unprecedented integration of the diagnostic and therapeutic environments.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Biotex, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/71278","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ADAPTIVE METHODS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/71280","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"ADAPTIVE METHODS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/71282","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"ADAPTIVE METHODS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/69863","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Acta ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/69865","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Acta ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261595","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"OXFORD BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261597","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"OXFORD BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261599","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"OXFORD BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261601","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"OXFORD BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/337944","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"TRIBOFILM RESEARCH INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"W-Band Short Pulse IMPATT Diode Development","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/286860","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":2000,"firm":"QUINSTAR TECHNOLOGY, INCORPORATED","reseach institution":null},{"title":"N/A","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/166346","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":2000,"firm":"Fibernetics LLC ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Munition Modeling &amp;
