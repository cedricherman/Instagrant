THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTES, WHICH NEED TO BE ISOLATED FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS. UNDERGROUND DISPOSAL IS AN OPTION THAT SHOW CONSIDERABLE PROMISE IF ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE TO ITS LONG-TERM SAFETY. A MAJOR CRITERION IN IDENTIFYING A SUITABLE SITE IS FOR THERE TO BE LITTLE WATER CIRCULATION TO PREVENT WIDESPREAD AND RAPID DISPERSAL IF THE STORAGE CONTAINERS ARE BREACHED. LOW CIRCULATION MAY BE ASSURED IF THE GROUNDWATER IS VERY OLD. THERE ARE MANY METHODS OF ESTIMATING GROUNDWATER AGES, BUT ATMOSPHERIC RADIONUCLIDES ARE, PERHAPS, THE MOST DIRECT AN MOST ACCURATE. TANDEM ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY HAS RECENTLY MADE 36C1 (3.1X105 YR.) AVAILABLE AS A WATER DATINGTECHNIQUE.

RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY (RIS) INVOLVES THE STEPWISE EXCITATION, IONIZATION, AND COUNTING OF ATOMS OF A PRE-SELECTED ELEMENT. BECAUSE NARROW-BAND LASERS ARE USED, SUFFICIENT OPTICAL POWER ENABLES ALL OF THE ATOMS OF THE SELECTED ELEMENT TO BE IONIZED, WHILE THE INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER ELEMENTS REMAINS NEGLIGIBLE. THE IONS FORMED ARE EXTRACTED AND PASSED THROUGH A MASS SPECTROMETER, THEREBY ACHIEVING ISOTOPIC SELECTIVITY. BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH ISOTOPE RATIOS IN 81KR COUNTING, SEVERAL ENRICHMENT STEPS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE COUNTING BY RIS.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IS TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POTENTIAL BY TESTING IN LIVING ANIMALS A DERMAPATCH FOR THE DELIVERY OF LEVONORGESTREL AND ESTRADIOL WHICH COMPRISE TWO MAJOR BIRTH CONTROL STEROIDS. THE DERMAPATCH TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY SYSTEM RELEASES THE DRUG FROM RATE CONTROLLING MICROPARTICLES (MICROCAPSULES AND/OR MICROSPHERES) WHICH ARE SUSPENDED IN A DERMATOLOGICALLY ACCEPTABLE VISCOUS LIQUID BASE. THE MICROCAPSULES RELEASE THE DRUG IN ZERO ORDER AND MAINTAIN A THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE LIQUID BASE. RELEASE IS CONTROLLED BY MICROCAPSULE SIZE AND THICKNESS OF THE CAPSULE WALL. THE MICROCAPSULES ALSO PREVENT DOSE DUMPING CAUSED BY ACCIDENTAL RUPTURE OF THE MEMBRANE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE SYSTEM IS A MACROPOROUS MEMBRANE WHICH DELIVERS A THIN LIQUID FILM OF THE VEHICLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN TO OCCLUDE THE SKIN. THE FILM FORCES HYDRATION OF THE STRATUM CORNEUM WITH WATER FROM THE LOWER LAYERS OF THE EPIDERMIS AND ACCELERATES THE DELIVERY OF THE STEROIDS. BECAUSE OF THE INTIMATE CONTACT BETWEEN THE SKIN SURFACE AND THE THERMODYNAMICALLY STABLE VISCOUS LIQUID BASE UNIFORM DELIVERY OF THE DRUG IS INSURED THROUGHOUT THE TREATMENT PERIOD. IN PRELIMINARY IN VITRO STUDIES WITH THE DERMAPATCH WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PERMEATION OF LEVONORGESTREL AND ESTRADIOL FROM THE SYSTEM IS CONSTANT AND SUSTAINED (FIGURE 1). WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PERMEATION RATES OF THE DERMAPATCH IN FRESHLY EXCISED MOUSE SKIN SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE MINIMUM 30 UG/DAY CONTRACEPTIVE DOSE FOR LEVONORGESTREL.

THIS INFORMATION COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DERMAPATCH WHICH COMBINES BOTH HORMONES AS A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD FOR ONCE-DAILY APPLICATION.

PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR DESULFURIZATION OF FUEL GASES WITH OXIDES OF IRON, ZINC, COBALT, ETC. IS LIMITED TO FUEL GASES WITH CO/C02 RATIOS THAT SELDOM EXCEED 1.0 AT TEMPERATURES THAT ARE GENERALLY LESS THAT 1200 (649 ). IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT FUEL GASES PRODUCED IN AN AIR BLOWNGASIFIER AT 1200F A CO/C02 OF ONE AND A CALORIFIC VALUE OF 110 BTU/SCF. IF AN AIR BLOWN GASIFIER IS OPERATED AT 1760F (927C), THE CO/C02 RATIO OF THE FUEL GAS MAY BE AS HIGH AS EIGHT AND THE CALORIFIC VALUE HAS BEEN CALCULATED TOBE 150 BTU/SCF-A 36% INCREASE IN BTU VALUE COMPARED TO THAT OBTAINED BY LOW TEMPERATURE GASIFIER OPERATION. THIS INCREASE IN BTU VALUE OF THE FUEL GAS DUE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURE GASIFIER OPERATION, AND DESULFURIZATION WITH CERIUM OXIDE AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE SENSIBLE HEAT IN THE FUEL GAS, SHOULD INCREASE THE OVERALL THERMAL EFFICIENCY OF ANY PROCESS USING FUEL GASES. THE DESULFURIZATION STEP IS A NON-CATALYTIC REACTION BETWEEN THE GAS AND THE SOLID, NON-STOICHIOMETRIC REACTANT: 2CEO(2-X) (S)+H2S(G)+1-2X)H2(G)= CE202S(S)+2(1-X)H20(G).

THE INITIAL PART OF THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LIGHT SCATTERING SPECTRA FROM SAMPLES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THE WAVELENGTH OF THE EXCITING LIGHT AS WELL AS THE PROBLEMS OF HANDLING, LOCATING AND PLACING THESE SMALL AEROSOLS, WHICH ARE NEITHER VISIBLE OR OBSERVABLE FROM THEIR REFLECTED LIGHT, IN THE MICRORAMAN SPECTROMETER. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN THE SPECTROSCOPY OF SMALL PARTICLES ARE THERMAL AND PHOTOCHEMICAL DEGRADATION. ONCE THESE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, THEN INSTRUMENTATION DESIGNS MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE FOLLOWING AREAS: GENERATING SUFFICIENT RAMAN PHOTONS, WHILE MAINTAINING SAMPLE INTEGRITY; COLLECTING THESE WITH EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH EFFICIENCY; AND THEN USING THEM PROPERLY. BASED ON THE INFORMATION GLEANED AND THE PROJECTED SPECTROMETER DESIGN, ANALYTICAL INFORMATION ON PARTICLE SIZE VS.

IN THIS APPROACH, AN ULTRA-THIN SELECTIVE BARRIER IS DEPOSITED VIA GLOW-DISCHARGE ONTO A HIGH-FLUX MATERIAL UNDERCOAT SUPPORTED BY A PROOUS SUBSTRATE.
