[{"title":"Non-Contaminating Compressor for Closed-Cycle Cryocoolers","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/201902","abstract":"Creare will develop a compressor that works atcryogenic temperatures: 80K or nearly 350 degress below zero fahrenheit. The compressor works at high pressures for Joule-Thompson (J-T cryocoolers. J-T cryocoolers contain heat exhangers and expansion elements that are orders of magnitude smaller than Reverse Brayton or Stirling cryocoolers. Further, J-T cryocoolers contain no active components in the cold end. Hence, in theory, they can reach a high efficiency. Exclusive of the compressor a one-stage J-T can attain 50% of Carnot, while a 3-stage J-T goes up to 75% of Carnot. Unfortunately, J-T cryocoolers have a weak link: the compressor. Today's high pressure compressors use lubricants and rubbing seals that contaminate the cooling system gas, which in turn causes the J-T restrictor to clog and fail. Hence, gas cleanup systems must be installed downstream, but they need frequent maintenance, and will not function properly in space. This project will develop a new compressor that has no rubbing seals and needs no lubricants. Thus, it won't clog the restrictor, and it removes the need for a gas cleanup system. It also increases the efficiency make it a candidate for cooling space sensor systems. The compressor can also serve in coolers for portable night vision systems that use only a fraction of a watt. Other applications are closed-cycle J-T recondenscers for MRI systems, and miniature refrigerators for superconducting devices.","agency":["Department of Defense","Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1991,"firm":"CREARE LLC ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TO IMPROVE RELIABILITY AND POWER QUALITY AND TO REDUCE COST OF PCS CONTROL","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/67511","abstract":"POWER CONDITIONERS CURRENTLY IN USE IN PHOTOVOLTAIC COGENERATION INSTALLATIONS DO NOT USE LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY.

ALTHOUGH MORE THAN 100 TESTS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH AS PREDICTORS OF PE, THERE IS AS YET NO RELIABLE MARKER OF EARLY DETECTION OF PE. WE FIRST EXAMINED PROTEINS THAT WERE KNOWN TO BE SECRETED FROM ENDOTHELIAL CELLS (SUCH AS FIBRONECTIN, ENDOTHELIN 1 AND ICAM 1) AS ELEVATED PLASMA MARKERS IN WOMEN WITH PE. SOME ENDOTHELIAL PROTEINS WERE FOUND TO BE INCREASED IN THE PLASMA IN LATE GESTATION IN WOMEN WITH PE, BUT ELEVATION OF THESE MARKERS DID NOT PRECEDE THE ONSET OF OTHER CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF PHASE I STUDY INVESTIGATORS EXPANDED THE PANEL OF CLINICAL SPECIMENS UNDER INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE URINE AS WELL AS SERUM, WITH THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING AN NON INVASIVE TEST. MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES WERE GENERATED AGAINST ANTIGENS IN THE URINE OF WOMEN WITH PE. SEVERAL ANTIBODIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT BIND PE-SPECIFIC URINARY ANTIGENS. THESE ANTIBODIES WERE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE PREECLAMPTIC AND NORMOTENSIVE WOMEN IN A PANEL OF 50 PREGNANCIES.

FOR ALL CUFFS, EVEN IF THE GAS PRESSURE IS MAINTAINED AT 300 MMHG, THE PRESSURE OF THE SOLUTION DECREASES CONSIDERABLY AS ITS VOLUME IS DISPENSED. BECAUSE BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS ARE ADMINISTERED TO PATIENTS THROUGH A BREAK IN THE PROTECTIVE BARRIER OF THE SKIN, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL OF EXPOSING THE PATIENT TO CROSS-CONTAMINATION.

THIS RESULTS IN A HIGHER DENSITY PLASMA AND LOWER PLASMA SHEATH POTENTIAL. THE HIGHER PLASMA DENSITY MEANS MORE CHARGED PARTICLES GENERATED WITH LOWER ENERGY PER PARTICLE, AND THE LOWER SHEATH POTENTIAL MEANS LESS VOLTAGE ACCELERATING POSITIVELY CHARGED PARTICLES TOWARD THE SUBSTRATE.

THIS PROJECT'S PHASE I EFFORT INVESTIGATES THE UTILITY OF APPLYING NEURAL NETWORKS TO RECOGNIZE AND EXPLOIT SIGNATURES EMBEDDED IN A SUITE OF WELLBORE LOGS FOR WELLS INHETEROGENEOUS RESERVOIRS. ESSENTIALLY, THE NETWORKS ARE TRAINED TO PREDICT WHICH ZONES IN A WELL WILL BE PRODUCTIVE,TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL PRODUCTIVITY OF THOSE ZONES, AND TO ESTIMATE KEY RESERVOIR PARAMETERS SUCH AS POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY. THE DATA USED FOR PHASE I ARE OBTAINED FROM THE COMPLEX SILURIAN INTERLAKE FORMATION OF THE WILLISTON BASIN IN NORTH DAKOTA AND CONSIST OF THE EXISTING CONVENTIONAL WELL LOGS AVAILABLE. KEY QUESTIONS BEING ANSWERED DURING PHASE I INCLUDE HOW ACCURATELY THE NETWORKS PREDICT THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBONS IN BORE HOLES, HOW MUCHWELLBORE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED FOR ACCURATE MODELS, AND HOW THE METHODOLOGY CAN BE EXTENDED TO PREDICT PARAMETERS SUCH AS POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY. ADDITIONALLY, PHASE I INCLUDES EXAMINATION OF HOW DATA FROM OTHER SOURCES, I.E., DRILL-STEM TESTS, CORE ANALYSIS, AND MUD LOGS, CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE PATTERN RECOGNITION METHODOLOGY, AND TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH DATA IMPROVE THE NETWORK'S ABILITY TO CHARACTERIZE HETEROGENEOUS RESERVOIRS. THE PRINCIPAL EFFORTIN PHASE I IS DIRECTED AT IDENTIFYING WHICH NEURAL NETWORKS ARE APPLICABLE TO THE PROBLEM, DEVELOPING A PROCESS BY WHICHTO TRAIN THESE NETWORKS, AND ULTIMATELY DEMONSTRATING THE VIABILITY OF UTILIZING A NEURAL NETWORK-BASED CONCEPT TO ENHANCE RESERVOIR CHARACTERIZATION.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1991,"firm":"Jason Associates Corp.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"INCORPORATION OF RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY (RAM) ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES INTO SIMULATION MODELING","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/205635","abstract":"REPROCESSING FACILITIES ARE COMPLEX CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL FACILITIES COMPRISING MANY WORKSTATIONS THAT MUST INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER.

THIS DEVICE IS SURGICALLY IMPLANTED IN THE MIDDLE EAR REPLACING THE INCUS. THE PIRP CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS. THEY INCLUDE; 1) A MALLEUS SENSOR, 2) A SIGNAL CONDITIONING AND POWER UNIT (SCPU), AND 3) A STAPES DRIVER. THE MALLEUS SENSOR IS ATTACHED TO THE HEAD OF THE MALLEUS BONE AND MEASURES THE STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS OF THE EARDRUM RESPONDING TO SOUND. OUTPUT FROM THE MALLEUS SENSOR IS AMPLIFIED BY THE SCPU AND VIBRATES THE STAPES DRIVER. A NON-RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM CELL SUPPLIES POWER TO ALL THREE COMPONENTS. THE PIRP WILL AMPLIFY SOUND PRESSURE AT THE EARDRUM. A MINIMUM 3 YEAR BATTERY LIFE IS EXPECTED. AN OUTPATIENT SURGICAL PROCEDURE CAN REPLACE THE LITHIUM CELL. SINCE THE PIRP IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MIDDLE EAR, THE NATURAL DYNAMIC RANGE AND FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF A HEALTHY MIDDLE EAR MAY BE RESTORED. THIS DEVICE HAS GREAT COSMETIC APPEAL BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXTERNAL APPARATUS. A TEAM CONSISTING OF A TECHNICAL MANAGER, TRANSDUCER ENGINEER, TWO EAR SURGEONS AND A BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER, WILL COMBINE THEIR EXPERTISE TO 1) DETERMINE THE OPERATING PARAMETERS FOR THE PIRP, 2) FORMULATE A SUITABLE FINAL DESIGN FOR EACH COMPONENT, AND 3) FABRICATE AND TEST A PROTOTYPE UNIT.

THIS INTENSITY-ENCODED SEQUENCING (IES) METHOD TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THREE RECENT ADVANCES CURRENTLY BEING MARKETED AND DEVELOPED AT UNITED STATES BIOCHEMICAL CORPORATION (USB). ONE IS SEQUENCE VERSION 2.0, A PATENTED ENZYME WHICH GENERATES EXCEPTIONAL SEQUENCING RESULTS. THE SECOND IS THE USE OF MN2+ AND INORGANIC PYROPHOSPHATASE WITH SEQUENASE. THESE MAKE CHAIN TERMINATION SEQUENCE-INDEPENDENT, GIVING UNIFORM BAND INTENSITIES. THUS, ALL FOUR DIDEOXY-NUCLEOTIDES CAN BE INCLUDED AT DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS IN A SINGLE REACTION; BAND INTENSITY DEPENDS ON THE CONCENTRATION, SO THE NUCLEOTIDE CAN BE DETERMINED FROM THE BAND INTENSITY. FINALLY, THE GELS ARE READ USING AN INEXPENSIVE PRECISION OPTICAL SCANNER TO BE INTRODUCED BY USB IN EARLY 1991. IES IS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO BE RUN IN ANY LABORATORY THAT DOES SEQUENCING.

The dilemma clearly recognized by AH-1W program managers is the requirement to properly maintain a growing fleet of aircrat under constrained budgets and anticipated reductions in manpower. Maintenance is a manpower intensive activity and reductions in manpower, unless anticipated and provided for, will result in an unacceptable reduction in material readiness and warfighting capability. There are two areas in which this reduction in manpower might be effectively countered; the application of automation to the maintenance process, and improvments in training. There are four general areas in which the proper application of microcoprocessor technology (automation) can improve the maintenance proecess: workload reduction, error reduction, incresed productivity, and the adding of new capabilities. Application of htis same technology can also be beneficially applied to training resulting in improved training while at the same time realizing an overall reduction in training requirements and time. The combined effect of these benefits is improved maintenance with a concurrent reduction in the manpower required.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1991,"firm":"Horizons Technology, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"ENERGY FIELDS FOR FIRE EXTINGUISHMENT","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/183245","abstract":"THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE ADJUSTMENT OF FLAMES BY ENERGY FIELDS TO CAUSE OR TO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR FIRE EXTINGUISHMENT, AND TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY FIELD WHICH PROVIDES OPTIMAL EFFECTS.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1991,"firm":"HUGHES ASSOC., INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"ADVANCED AEROTHERMOCHEMISTRY ALGORITHM","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/184275","abstract":"A COMPUTER BASED ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED THAT INTEGRTES AN ADVANCED NAVIER-STOKES HYPERSONIC FLOW SOLVER WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART MATERIAL RESPONSE COMPUTER CODES TO CREATE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR REENTRY VEHICLE HEATSHIELD DESIGN.

HOWEVER, THIS KIND OF CONTROL IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR MANIPULATORS DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC MOTORS WITH GEARED TRANSMISSIONS, PRIMARILY DUE TO FRICTION IN THE DRIVE TRAIN. YET THESE TYPES OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN THE MOST PRACTICAL FOR MANY APPLICATIONS. TWO PRIMARY TYPES OF CONTROL STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO DATE FOR FORCE CONTROL WITH THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS. ONE USES THE FORCE ERROR TO ADJUST THE TORQUE OF THE DRIVE MOTOR. THE OTHER UTILIZES FORCE FEEDBACK TO COMMAND MOTOR POSITIONS, RELYING ON COMPLIANCE IN THE SYSTEM FOR TRANSLATING POSITION TO FORCE. THE FORMER APPROACH TYPICALLY RESULTS IN SLUGGISH, NOISY CONTROL AND THE LATTER APPROACH TYPICALLY EXHIBITS POOR BANDWIDTH. NEITHER APPROACH ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES MANIPULATORS WHICH ARE MODERATELY BACK-DRIVABLE. WE PROPOSE AN ADAPTIVE FORCE CONTROL SYSTEM BASED ON THE \"BACKPROPAGATED ADAPTIVE CRITIC\" ARCHITECTURE, WHICH UTILIZES PRINCIPLES FROM DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING AND NEURAL NETWORKS TO ACHIEVE REAL-TIME ADAPTATION. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES FEW ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PLANT DYNAMICS, AND A WIDE VARIETY OF SENSOR INPUTS CAN EASILY BE INCORPORATED. FURTHERMORE, EFFECTS WHICH DEPEND ON PAST AS WELL AS CURRENT STATES, SUCH AS BACKLASH, CAN ALSO BE ACCOMMODATED.

SatCon Technology Corporation proposes to design, fabricate, and demonstrate an integrated swashplate hydraulic actuation system for control of helicopter vibrations which will allow improvements in all three these areas. This system will improve operability by improving maneuverability, agility, and speed; improve supportability by increasing reliability; and improve survivability by decreasing noise signature. In conventional helicopters, control of the rotor is achieved by the use of a swashplate. For a number of rotor control problems, however, the existing hydraulically actuated swashplate is sub-optimal. Due to the limited frequency response of the swashplate's hydraulic actuators, existing swashplates have insufficient bandwidth to provide active control of higher harmonic helicopter rotor vibrations. However, the actuator bandwidth problem can be alleviated if the existing hydraulic actuators are replaced with a modern state-of-the-art hydraulic System. This approach requires a minimum modification of the existing hardware while achieving a significant reduction in the vibration of the fuselage.

THE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY REPRESENTED BY CURRENT PROTOTYPE PILOT-VEHICLE INTERFACES (PVI) SUCH AS THE ONE NEEDED FOR ADVANCED ROTORCRAFT DEMANDS: 1) A RATIONAL BASIS FOR EVALUATION AND DESIGN ANALYSIS FOR DISPLAY AND ACTION EXECUTION SYSTEMS. 2) A SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED METHOD FOR PREDICTING MULTI-MODAL MULTI-CHANNEL PILOT WORKLOAD AND PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS WHILE USING THE SYSTEMS, AND 3) EXPLORATION OF ALTERNATIVE, PREFERABLY PRECOGNITIVE, METHODS FOR PILOTS/AIRCRAFT COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTROL.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1991,"firm":"Cybernet Systems Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A COMPUTER BASED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR JPL IMAGE DATA IN EDUCATION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/123587","abstract":"USING THE DATA FROM PLANETARY EXPLORATION NOW AVAILABLE THROUGH NASA AND JPL, THIS EFFORT TARGETS ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS, MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLEOF ALL LEARNING ABILITIES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DATA FUSION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TRACKING AND SURVEILLANCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT EVEN AGAINST DIESEL THREATS. SUCH A SYSTEM WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF MULTIPLE SOURCES AND RECEIVING ARRAYS. PRESENT DAY DATA FUSION ALGORITHMS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF HANDLING MULTIPLE SOURCES AND RECEIVERS COUPLED WITH MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION PATHS AND FALSE ALARMS. WE PROPOSE TO COMBINE THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO TRACKER (LRT) WITH MATCHED MODE PROCESSING TO DEVELOP A SHALLOW WATER DATA FUSION SYSTEM. LRT IS A DISCRETE, RECURSIVE, NON-LINEAR FILTER THAT COMPUTES ESTIMATES OF TARGET STATE (POSITION, VELOCITY, DEPTH) IN TERMS OFPROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS. LRT HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS NON-LINEAR MEASUREMENT DATA WITH NON-GAUSSIAN MEASUREMENT ERRORS IN SITUATIONS INVOLVING ACTIVE SENSORS, MULTIPLE RECEIVERS, MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION PATHS, MANEUVERING TARGETS, AND FALSE TARGETS. MATCHED MODE PROCESSING IS A NEW TECHNIQUE THAT PRODUCES TARGET RANGE AND DEPTH ESTIMATES FROM SIGNALS RECEIVED AT VERTICAL ARRAYS EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION PATHS.
