[{"title":"Novel Dopant Strategies for the Development of Submicron PZT Ceramics","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/814223","abstract":"The fabrication of submicron piezoelectric ceramics (PZT-5) with properties comparable to commercially available coarse grained materials was demonstrated in the Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. This work was accomplished in collaboration with the Pennsylvania State University, through a fundamental understanding of the domain state in these materials. Specifically, novel doping and compositional strategies were correlated to a specific domain state, i.e., domain size and distribution, number of variants, and transgranular domain switching to allow the previous lower limit in grain size for piezoelectric ceramics can be reduced. These submicron grain size piezoelectric materials have the piezoelectric activity of commercially available materials but will exhibit superior mechanical properties.The Phase II STTR program will extend this work to other piezoelectric materials including PZT-5H and PZT-8. The process will then be scaled to a pilot production level and optimized to maximize yields and minimize costs. Process and quality controls will be implemented to ensure repeatability of the manufacturing process. It will be demonstrated that devices requiring further miniaturization of piezoelectric active regions such as high frequency biomedical transducers (>20mhz) and low voltage (","agency":["Department of Defense","Navy","Department of Defense"],"program":"STTR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"TRS CERAMICS, INC.","reseach institution":"Penn State University"},{"title":"High Current Ion Source for Heavy Ion Fusion","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/67319","abstract":"40268                                            November 6, 1996\nAlameda Applied Sciences Corporation\n\nInduction linear accelerators that produce energetic heavy ion beams are a prime candidate for power-producing fusion reactors.  This project will develop and demonstrate a high vacuum arc ion source that can reliably deliver high current, low emittance beams of heavy (A=100-238) ions with charge states 1+ to 3+, pulse widths from 1 to 20 \u00bfs, and at repetition rates ~10 Hz.  The challenge for Phase I is to find innovative ways to preserve the good properties of existing vacuum arc ion sources when extrapolated into the new regime required for heavy ion fusion. Existing sources offer low emittance with >100 \u00bfs pulse widths at modest currents. The Phase I effort is aimed at increasing the current while preserving the low emittance in short (1-20 \u00bfs) pulses. The Phase II effort will validate the source at repetition rates relevant for heavy ion fusion and demonstrate source lifetime and reliability.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The vacuum arc ion source should find several commercial applications including heavy ion fusion, surface and materials characterization, heavy ion synchrotron injection and isotope separation.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ALAMEDA APPLIED SCIENCES CORP","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Feasibility of Using Impulse Radar to Detect and Identify Detonators","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/67795","abstract":"This proposal seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of using impulse radar techniques to detect and identify explosive detonators.

In view of the tremendous diversity of biomass feedstocks, a great need exists for a robust, comprehensive model that could be utilized to predict yields, composition, and properties of pyrolysis products as a function of feedstock characteristics and process conditions.  The innovation of this project involves modifying and exisiting advanced coal devolatilization model, and making it suitable for pyrolysis of biomass.  The soundness of this approach is based on numerous similarities between biomass and coal.  There are important differences, however, which preclude direct application of the coal model.  The objective of Phase I program is to create a predictive biomass-pyrolysis model incorporating a detailed understanding of the underlying physical and chemical processes.  This will be accomplished in three tasks:  1) selection and characterization of several materials representing the main types of biomass; 2) model development; 3) model validation.  The Phase II program will focus on model refinement and the creation of a software package for Phase III commercialization.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"GAS STORAGE USING MICROPOROUS CARBON ADSORBENTS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75150","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Sensors for Performance Monitoring of Advanced Gas Turbines","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75172","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"On-Line Control of Particulate and Volatile Air Toxic Emmissions from Thermal Treatment Systems","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75216","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR PHASE I: Simultaneous Mercury, SO2, and NOx Control in Coal Combustion","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/75248","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"AN INFANT EEG SYSTEM FOR HOME APNEA MONITORING","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76066","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Directed Reflectivity, Long Life AMTEC Condenser","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76659","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ADVANCED MODULAR POWER SYSTEMS","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HIGH THROUGHPUT INTEGRATED PCR-CE SYSTEM","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76675","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Molecular Systems,","reseach institution":null},{"title":"LARGE AREA APD&#039;S WITH HIGH QUANTUM EFFICIENCY AT 1.06 MICRONS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/76895","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Advanced Photonix","reseach institution":null},{"title":"ENHANCED COMBUSTION PULSEJET ENGINES (ECPJ) FOR MACH 0 TO 3 APPLICATIONS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/77115","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ADVANCED PROJECTS RESEARCH, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR Phase I: A Fully-Depleted Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Technology for Scientific Applications","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/77335","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aracor","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR Phase I: X-Ray Thermometer for Rapid Thermal Processing","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/77349","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aracor","reseach institution":null},{"title":"High-Gain Monocapillary Optics","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/77357","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aracor","reseach institution":null},{"title":"NONDESTRUCTIVE TOMOGRAPHIC ACQUISITION OF STIFFNESS &amp; DENSITY INFORMATION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/77391","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aracor","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Reusable, Non-Toxic, Non-Lethal Activated Barrier to Delay Unauthorized Intruders by Vision Obscuration","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/77502","abstract":"40436                                           November 18, 1996\nAdvanced Safeguards, Inc.\n\nIn high-security Department of Energy and Department of Defense facilities, cold-chemical smoke generators are used to produce visual obscurants in order to delay unauthorized intruders. The technology is based on the rapid rejection of two chemicals, contained within the device, into the surrounding air where they combine to form a fine particulate, opaque cloud (smoke).  While this device provides good visual obscuration, the stored chemicals are toxic and potentially harmful to humans, the unit is expensive to manufacture, and it can be \"activated\" only once.

This project will explore the feasibility of monitoring tritium by using an ultra low density (milligrams per cubic centimeter range) silica aerogel as a carrier of a scintillation phosphor. The phosphor will be perfused into the aerogel in the gas phase, where it will be adsorbed onto the existing silica structure of the aerogel.  Because the low density aerogel is highly permeable to gases, every tritium atom in the gas will be close to a region of space containing scintillation phosphor.  In this way, the problem of absorption by the ambient air, of the low energy beta particles emitted by tritium is avoided. The novel aspect of this research is the multi-phase (aerogel/ phosphor) scintillator material; in other respects, the tritium monitor is based on the well established principles of scintillation counting, using standard photomultiplier tubes and pulse counting circuitry.  Naphthalene will be used as a typical aromatic scintillation phosphor, used in conventional scintillation counters.  The project will determine how much scintillation phosphor can be put into the foam, how well it works, and what kind works best. \n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The tritium monitor will be more sensitive, rugged and reliable than existing monitors based on other techniques (such as ionization chambers).  It will have a commercial market wherever tritium must be monitored, and may also be applicable to the real-time monitoring of radon, a well known health hazard in buildings.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR PHASE I: Modifying Hard Carbon Coatings for Improved Tribological Properties","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/79922","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"An Optical Water Vapor Sensor for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/79928","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Nitrogen Dioxide Detector for the Clean Troposphere","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/79971","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Passive Two-Band Sensor For Sunlight Excited Chlorophyll Fluorescence","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/79989","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Aerodyne Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Diagnostic Development for Characterizing Fuel Droplet Temperatures in Spray Flames","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/80191","abstract":"Development of efficient spray combustors requires a complete understanding of fundamental phenomena that influence and control the overall spray combustion process.

For detecting X-ray energies typically used in biological macromolecular crystallography, thissensor will provide high resolution, high detection efficiency, and a fast time response, allowing the fullpotential of the modern synchrotron sources to be realized.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"AVALANCHE PHOTODIODES FOR SCINTILLATING FIBER DETECTORS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/83756","abstract":"A HIGH SPEED, HIGH SENSITIVITY AVALANCHE PHOTODIODE (APD) ARRAY IS BEING INVESTIGATED TO MEET THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS OF DETECTORS FOR HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS THE CENTRAL TRACKER VERTEX DETECTOR AND CALORIMETERS WHICH ARE BEING DESIGNED FOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED PARTICLE PHYSICS DETECTORS.

The ribonuclease protection assay is an increasingly utilized techniquein molecular biology affording sensitive and quantitative measurement of mRNA levels. The ability ofthe assay to detect multiple mRNA levels simultaneously makes this technique a unique and powerfultool for use in research and diagnostic applications. In a ribonuclease protection assay, autoradiographyof the polyacrylamide gel-resolved products represents the endpoint of the experiment. However, allof the available nonisotopic detection protocols require blotting of nucleic acids onto a sold support priorto detection. Therefor, we propose an approach which will circumvent this requirement and allowdetection directly in the gel used to resolve the nucleic acids. Our initial studies demonstrated that invitro transcripts containing 4-thiouridine are both functional in ribonuclease protection assays and canbe detected in gel down to 1 picomole by a colormetric detection protocol using N-ethylamaleimide andbase. During phase I, we will synthesize a derivative of N-ethylmaleimide which has been reported togreatly potentiate the sensitivity of thiol detection. Furthermore, in an effort to extend the sensitivityof ribonuclease protection assays beyond that attainable with radioactivity, we will synthesize a thiolatedderivative of the chemiluminescent molecule isoluminol. This derivative will be coupled to either4-thiouridine- or 5 mercuriuridine-substituted transcripts and detected using a non-enzymatic, butcatalytic, oxidation system with molecules which can all readily diffuse in and out of a polyacrylamidegel matrix. Once we have developed a nonisotopic ribonuclease protection assay, it will be utilized witha panel of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene probes which are used extensively at Ambion for thedevelopment of single base mismatch technologies. Ultimately, the technologies which we develop willhave wide applications in molecular biology research extending beyond ribonuclease protection assays.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"AMBION DIAGNOSTICS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SYNTHESIS OF RNA CANCER VACCINES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/86848","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"AMBION DIAGNOSTICS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF AT LEAST 100 DIFFERENT MRNAS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/86872","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"AMBION DIAGNOSTICS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HIGH PRECISION CONTROL AND HEALTH MONITORING OF ADVANCE SPACECRAFT","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/87287","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"AMERICAN GNC CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"NONLINEAR REAL-TIME HIGH RELIABILITY ENGINE CONTROL","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/87311","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"AMERICAN GNC CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Interactive Multimedia to Teach Asthma Self Management","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/87550","abstract":"We will investigate and develop an interactive multimedia for asthma self-management educationtargeted toward children aged 6-9 inclusive.

Equivalent system temperature, Ts, is a significant parameter in quantifying the antenna system/link performance, because it represents the noise power spectral density in antenna system figures-of-merit, such as receiver gain/system temperature (G/T), and end-to-end Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).  Unfortunately, Ts is dependent on many parameters.  This presents a significant problem in predicting system performance in the operational environment (indoors - the antenna sees roughly the ambient temperature, outdoors - the antenna sees many other noise sources that may vary significantly over time).  An innovative computer methodology is proposed that uses a novel application of noise theory and an integration of new and existing algorithms to estimate a statistical \"worst case\" in the operating environment based upon a desired availability.  The specific objectives of the Phase I effort are to:  develop a method to measure the composite system noise fugure; develop a statistical method for predicting system ambient operating temperature; develop a method to statistically estimate equivalent antenna temperature; and select supporting computer algorithms.

Reproduction of broiler lines increasingly is a problem and already is limiting for turkeys.  Currently, breeders or producers can identify males of low fertility only retrospectively after a costly failure.  However, elimination of the 25-35% of males likely to be of lowest fertility before they were turned in with hens would increase fertility by 10 percentage units.  Such culling presently is impossible because there is no simple, low cost test which is reasonably predictive of fertility of a rooster or turkey tom.  This project will develop an assay for field measurement of the combined attribute of sperm motility plus sperm binding to a substrate prepared from a purified extract from unfertilized chicken eggs.  The assay to be developed mimics, in vitro, the initial binding of a rooster spermatozoon to the vitelline membrane of an unfertilized hen's egg.  Early preliminary data demonstrate a strong relationship (r^2 = 0.81) between sperm binding to the microwell used for a prototype assay and fertility of the same semen.  Two Objectives will be addressed in Phase I.  Sperm from roosters of unknown fertility or from lines selected for high or low fertility will be used in 3 experiments with the goal of developing a repeatable and sensitivity fluorescent, microwell sperm-binding assay.  The 4th experiment will demonstrate feasiblity of the assay by showing, in a predictive manner, that roosters designated as \"bad\" or \"good\" on the basis of the newly developed assay differ in fertility and that, for a simulated population, sperm binding is predictive of fertility.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"BIOPORE, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HIGHLY PURIFIED AND STABLE THERAPEUTIC BOTULINUM TOXIN","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/109852","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"BIOPURE CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"NEW MONITOR OF SALIVA GLUCOSE FOR DIABETICS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/109908","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Bioquant, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"DNA Amplification from Microdissected Chromosomes","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/109995","abstract":"We will develop kits, services, and reagents useful in the processes of generating and employingamplified DNA mini-libraries (i.e., amplified products) from microdissected human chromosomefragments.

Biological fungicides are needed as alternatives to chemical pesticides, especially for crops receiving heavy chemical applications.  However, biofungicides require special formulation to be consistently effective, affordable and compatible with standard practices. \n\nWe are developing spray formulations of biofungicide for control of fruit and foliar diseases, but formulation development is needed.  Fruit and turf diseases are important targets for biocontrol.  For grapes, over $100 million is spent annually for dicarboximide fungicides for Botrytis control, and resistance is developing.  Golf courses receive over $90 million in fungicides in the U. S. alone, exposing the general public to potentially anti-androgenic fungicides and contaminating surrounding surface waters.  Our biofungicides have been effective in the field, but control is inconsistent due to inadequate formulation adjuvants and incompatibility with chemical residues in spray equipment.\n\nThe proposed work will test formulation adjuvants as nutritive spreader/stickers, which have been shown to be critically important.  Also, dose ranging, compatibility with chemicals, and spray tank decontamination procedures will be tested.

Medical studies indicates that Beta-carotene is preventative and sometimes terapeutic against malignant tumors, lung cancer, colon cancer, esophagus cancer, and skin cancer.\n\nIt is the focus of this proposal to develop a new separation process for recovery of natural carotene from carotene-containing vegetable oils such as palm oil.  Conventional methods for this separation include liquid/liquid extraction, liquid chromatography, and packed-bed adsorption.  Conventional liquid/liquid extraction is undesirable because of the tendency to form stable emulsions--leading to loss of solvents and expensive waste treatment.  Chromatography and packed-bed processes have problems of bed compression and high pressure drops.  The process that we propose to develop utilizes a highly selective carotene-complexing agent in a membrane-extraction process.  This process promises to be superior to conventional technology because it allows emulsion-free liquid/liquid extraction.  In addition, the proprietary complexing agent promises to have very high selectivity and capacity for this separation.  In Phase I our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach for recovery of natural carotene from palm oil.

The key to reducing thismortality rate is early and accurate diagnosis, preferably by a simple non-invasive procedure that couldbe used in the emergency room. Recent animal studies have shown that the intestinal tract is highlysensitive to arterial blood supply. The changes in magnetic activity that result from ischemia happenwithin minutes and are quite large. Preliminary measurements have also been made to show thefeasibility of measuring the biomagnetic signal from human intestines. The signals are large and can beeasily measured using a high sensitivity superconducting magnetometer.

Low power dissipation and high temperature superconductor implementation should also make them very suitable for commercial and military satellite based sensing and detection applications.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"CONDUCTUS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Docking Protein Densities","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/132356","abstract":"The structure of protein assemblies is largely determined by non-covalent interactions betweenproteins. The importance of shape complementarity of interacting molecular surfaces is generallyrecognized, but it is not easily studied, due to difficulties in quantifying shape. This proposal will developmethods for (1) characterizing the shape of protein surfaces, and (2) predicting complexes betweenproteins of known three-dimensional structure. The methods will be designed to work, even if thesurface amino acid side chains have indeterminate orientation, as is often the case in proteincrystallographic studies. Conformational flexibility will be modeled as partial occupancy (density) on athree-dimensional grid. The side chains' averaged density will be used for shape measurement. Areliable protein-docking computer program will be a quicker and less expensive means to study a proteinassociation than an x-ray crystallographic experimental study of the complex. Applications include: (1)predicting how a monoclonal antibody binds to its protein antigen, (2) the assembly of viral coat proteinmonomers into capsides, and (3) the genetic disease sickle cell anemia, where hemoglobin monomersassociate in an incorrect way. The software developed will be licensed to academic, governmental andindustry scientists researching the molecular basis of disease.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Michael L Connolly","reseach institution":null},{"title":"DOCKING PROTEIN DENSITIES","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/132362","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Michael L Connolly","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A COMMERCIAL SIMULATOR FOR HEALTH PHYSICS TRAINING","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/132577","abstract":"RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING AN INNOVATIVE NEW APPROACH TO LABORATORY TRAINING IN HEALTH PHYSICS, I.E., THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPUTER SIMULATOR THAT CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF ACTUAL RADIATION SOURCES IN LABORATORY TRAINING.

In this approach, a polarized light source is incident on the surface of interest at oblique incidence, and the reflected polarization state is measured in about 0.5 ms.  The optical properties of the surface, including athe normal spectral emissivity are then derived.  Recently, we have developed a laser polarimetric appartus using this approach and have achieved 1-3% accuracy in emissivity measurements on solid and liquid materials pulseheated over a 0.5 s time period.  These successful efforts form the basis of this proposal which seeks to extend the laser polarimetric approach to be capable of 1 MHz measurement bandwidth for application to very rapid pulse-heating experiments which last 50-100 us.  The Phase I work will be aimed at establishing:  (i) detector and electronics capable of 10 MHz bandwidth, (ii) design of the optics to accommodate specimen motion which occurs during the rapid pulse, (iii) methods to eliminate or minimize the incandescent background from interfering with the laser signal, (iv) methods to accurately measure the magnitude of the laser signal, and (v) testing of the proposed methods at the pulse-heating facility.  These key design problems will be investigated, both analytically and experimentally during the Phase I effort.

Helicopters now use slung buckets to deliver water, retardants and foam to fire sites.  The urgency of time (fire control lines must be established before the fire overruns them) and the need for expensive equipment (helicopters typically cost $20 million and rent for $5,000 per hour) demand that rapid -- and controllable -- technologies be used.  Unfortunately, current bucket technology does not have any means to control the release of material delivered, except by varying the speed and height of the aircraft.  With the smart bucket design proposed herein, the pilot simply selects the coverage level and volume of the material to be deposited.  A system controller then opens the bucket valve on command and varies its position to provide uniform flow rate and deposition.  More strategic use of the bucket contents will then occur.  Instrument inputs for wind speed, ground speed, acceleration and release height will be used to adjust valve position to obtain the desired coverage level under the helicopter and downwind of its flight path.  When installed, this system will reduce operational costs, increase pilot safety, and save millions of dollars in resources (life and property) by putting down reliable fire control lines and/or extinguish the fire more quickly.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Continuum Dynamics Inc ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Fast

It is possible to implement the use of composting technology to decrease the amount of material flooding the waste stream and reduce pollutants.  Each small town may not have the resources to purchase the equipment necessary to successfully compost.  Towns along the Alaska highways are the target for application of this solution to waste disposal.  The highway offers a way to transport equipment for use by all the communities.\n\nOur objective is to determine if there is enough organic materials, in the correct proportions, to use composting as an alternative waste management system.  We will list which communities in Alaska are accessible along the highways.  Data collected from government and private sector reports, as well as community surveys, will be compiled.  Our assessment of the data will indicate which communities are possible candidates for this alternative method.

A problem common with these systems is their lack of reliability when subjected to intense radiation.  For example, it is common for thermocouples to prematurely fail under neutron irradiation, and it has been shown that diagnostic coils and sensors which are currently in use in fusion systems will be unacceptable in the next generation fusion power plants.  This lack of reliability is caused by an irradiation induced degradation in the insulating material used in these components.  Specifically, neutron and gamma irradiation can cause both an immediate, transient degradation as well as a permanent degradation in the resistive capability of insulating material. This project will examine the permanent degradation in the insulating capability of mineral insulated diagnostic probes used in fusion systems in order to understand the conduction mechanisms of mineral insulated probes subjected to neutron irradiation environments.  For several combinations of materials and processing parameters, the radiation induced electrical degradation (RIED) will be quantitatively measured.  The most radiation resistant combinations will be carried into Phase II.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The mechanisms responsible for the degradation in mineral insulated cables should be understood, and concrete radiation hardened diagnostic probes, to be used in fusion systems such as ITER, will be identified.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Delta M Corp.on","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Protein Quantity and Quality for Channel Catfish Feeds","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/144570","abstract":"Protein is the most expensive component comprising a catfish feed; thus, a reduction in feed cost can most likely be achieved by either reducing the concentration of dietary protein, by using less expensive plant proteins, or by a combination of these factors.

However, the fluorescence techniques used to get the qualitative and quantitative chemical information do not have the ability to detect such nonfluorescent materials as chlorinated hydrocarbons.  This project will develop a sensor, based on characteristics of laser light scattered from material surfaces, called Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), to detect these contaminants.  SERS is sensitive only to the layer of contaminants in close proximity to the sensor.  The quantity and type of molecules at the sensor is controlled through the use of very specific affinity coatings.  This feature, in combination with SERS fluorescence quenching, avoids potential interference from humic or other fluorescence materials.  SERS can be performed with a low power diode laser, whereas fluorescence requires a tunable or pulsed source.  The near-infrared excitation and the Raman scattered light can be efficiently transmitted to and from the cone head sensor with conventional fiber optics.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: Direct commercial applications are expected in the area of ground contamination mapping using cone penetrometers.

The low productivity of cement-bonded particleboard plants and the inhibitory effects of some wood species resulting from the slow setting and hardening of cement have led to relatively high initial costs.  Early exposure of cement binders to carbon dioxide can substantially reduce the setting and hardening times.  Industrial-scale implementation of the carbonation technology, however, has been hindered by the difficulties in achieving uniform carbonation effects and controlling the rate of carbonation reactions, and also by the high cost and unavailability of CO2 in large volumes.  In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose to replace pure CO2 with a blend of CO2 and air, and eventually with CO2-enriched exhaust gases which are readily available at low cost and are responsible for the greenhouse effect.  We have hypothesized that the air content of the exhaust gas opens channels into the board for thorough penetration of CO2, and also helps control the rate of reactions to make industrial-scale implementations more practical.  Phase I research will determine the CO2 concentration and vacuum/gassing regime best suiting the production of particleboard.

This assessment is made substantially more difficult because the PCBs are a mixture of 209 possible chloro-isomers; the most common mixtures may not represent the most significant toxic or biologically active components. Consequently, there is growing recognition that the congener specific analysis of PCBs in the environment is required for the evaluation of the PCBs environmental impact. However, the effort and expense associated with the analysis of these compounds by capillary gas chromatography place substantial restraints on the required studies. Immunoassay based analytical methods have demonstrated the ability to provide both high throughput screening and quantitative analyses. This method provides for a marked reduction in both sample preparation due to high specificity and instrumentation requirements due to assay simplicity.

In addition, some lepidopteran species that initially were susceptible to Bacillus thuringiensis have developed resistance.  \n\nUnderstanding the molecular mechanism for the insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins represents a significant area of research accomplishment.  One rationale for this research is that such understanding will assist efforts to improve the toxicity of crystal proteins through protein engineering.\n\nProtein engineering efforts have been aided by two important findings on the mechanism of toxicity of crystal proteins.  Briefly stated these findings are 1) Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins bind to cells lining the insect midgut; 2) Bound proteins form pores causing colloid osmotic lysis of the insect gut cells.  It is presumed that lysis of gut cells results in insect death.\n\nThis proposal will explore promising avenues of research which will add to the understanding of the mechanism of toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Ecogen, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Adaptive spatial filtering methods are proposed which are inherently suitable to utilizing many sensors and actuators to acheive superior control and monitoring of structures for vibration and shape control and damage detection.

Geraniums and roses together constitute a significant portion of this value.  Grey mold, caused by Botrytis cinerea Pers.:Fr. is prevalent and often devastating under the cool, moist conditions which are common in greenhouses where the crops are produced.  The fungus attacks all of the above ground portions of the plants, but foliar and floral blights are the primary causes of economic loss, especially for roses used in cut flower production.  Currently registered chemical fungcides used to control this disease are relatively ineffective due to resistance developed by Botrytis against the chemicals.  Additionally, the heavy use of chemical pesticides causes health concerns to applicators, greenhouse workers and the consumer public which purchases the flowers.  The proposed Phase I research would evaluate the use of multiple microbial pest control agents (MPCAs) to combat this disease.  Combinations of beneficial fungi, bacteria and yeast will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo to evaluate their ability to prevent grey mold and to overcome fungicide resistant strains of Botrytis.

Reduction of carbonate fuel cell cost is desired to further stimulate market interest.  In current carbonate fuel cell matrix manufacturing, the ceramic material, typically lithium aluminate, is dispersed in a solvent to which organic binders and plasticizers are later added to form a bindered ceramic slurry.  The slurry is subsequently formed into thin sheet layers in a tape casting machine, where the solvents are evaporated by applying dry air and/or heat.  The organic solvent is incinerated or condensed and collected for recycling. This project will develop technology to replace the solvents by a less costly, aqueous solvent substitute.  Phase I will identify an aqueous binder system, compatible for use in the carbonate fuel cell, and develop a slurry manufacturing method.  Lab-size tapes from these slurries will be cast and evaluated.  Finally, a laboratory-size single cell will be constructed and operated.  The manufacturing process will be scaled-up and optimized, enabling full area stack test evaluation during Phase II.\n\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  This process should facilitate commercialization of the carbonate fuel cell power plant for applications such as dispersed and baseload utility power generation, as well as for cogeneration applications.

Loss of electrolyte through evaporation appears to impact the useful life of the carbonate fuel cell.  Fuel cell life may be extended by about additional five years if the electrolyte vaporization loss is fully suppressed.  The goal of the proposed research is to significantly reduce electrolyte vaporization loss (\u00bf 50%) by internally recovering the electrolyte vapor out of the gas streams and returning it back into the cells active components.  The feasibility of electrolyte recovery from vapor and returning it to the cell will be evaluated in Phase I by out-of-cell and single cell tests.  The design will be optimized and evaluated in the full area stacks in Phase II.  Full-size stack demonstration and commercial implementation is also expected to occur in Phase II.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: Successful completion of this project should extend the useful operating life of the carbonate fuel cell significantly beyond the current commercial entry life of five years.

By measuring the time it takes for a step-waveform to propagate down and back an open circuited transmission line, one can determine the dielectric constant of the media.  Regression equations can then be used to determine water content from the dielectric constant.  Problems occur, however, in regions of high salinity (or electrical conductivity) in that the phase velocity and attenuation of electromagnetic waves as well as the characteristic impedance of the transmission lines are functions of frequency as opposed to constants.  This results in dispersion of the low frequency components and attenuation of the high frequency components of a TDR step-waveform which causes errors in the determination of water content.  This Phase I research project will investigate using existing electromagnetic and soil physics models to develop an algorithm to enable TDR systems to accurately measure water content and salinity over a wide range of water contents, salinities and soil types with a minimum amount of calibration.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Flugstad Engineering","reseach institution":null},{"title":"An Improved Material and Low-Cost Fabrication Options for Candle Filters","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/167994","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Fluidyne Engineering Corp.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Pulsed Induction Joining of Sapphire to Metal for Gyrotron Windows","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168213","abstract":"41291                                           November 19, 1996\nFM Technologies, Inc.\n\nThe window is currently the single most serious mode of failure of high power gyrotrons, a device for heating magnetic fusion plasmas.  This project will develop a new technique for joining ceramic materials, used for these windows, to the metals that hold the windows in place. A pulsed induction coil system will be used to set up an induced current that causes the temperature of the material to rise rapidly to the joining temperature. Because currents are induced only within the portion of the specimen that is enclosed by the coil, rapid heating of just the interlayer can be achieved. The pulsed method uses a peak power that is many times greater than conventional induction heating, while greatly reducing the total heating time.  In previous work, a first generation pulsed induction system was built and tested by heating a copper ring 1000oC in less than one second.  In Phase I, test specimens consisting of disks of sapphire and tubes of stainless steel will be joined. The microstructure of the test specimens will be examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their mechanical integrity will be evaluated.  In Phase II, test specimens representing \"racetrack\" shaped windows will be joined and evaluated.  The windows will be large enough for testing with high power gyrotrons currently under development.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  High power gyrotrons are a critical component of Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH), a preferred and promising heating method for magnetic fusion plasmas. This project, if successful, will provide a method for attachment of low-loss windows in gyrotron oscillators with minimal residual stress, which will greatly increase window design flexibility.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"FM TECHNOLOGIES INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Bending System for Recirculating Accelerators with Space-Charged Dominated Beams","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168269","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"FM TECHNOLOGIES INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"An Induction Modulator for a Relativistic-Klystron Two-Beam Accelerator","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168273","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"FM TECHNOLOGIES INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Suppression of Voltage Breakdown in High-Gradient Radiofrequency Cavities","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168279","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"FM TECHNOLOGIES INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Accelerating Cavities for a Relativistic Klystron Two-Beam Accelerator","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168285","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"FM TECHNOLOGIES INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Micro-Pulse Electron Injector","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168291","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"FM TECHNOLOGIES INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Single Mode Tunable Diode Lasers From 1.9 To 5.0 Millimeters","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168476","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Focused Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HIGH STRENGTH-TO-WEIGHT TAPERED HOYTETHER FOR LEO TO GEO PAYLOAD TRANSPORT","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168743","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"TETHERS UNLIMITED, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Dynamical Instrument for Machining Centers","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/169459","abstract":"In the program, we will develop a measurement system based on the dynamics of the machining process.

The acceleration gap must satisfy three major criteria:  hold-off of the applied 100 kV voltage, low transverse impedance for beam break-up minimization, and low longitudinal impedance at the beam modulation frequency and harmonics to minimize power loss.  Preliminary studies indicate that the transverse impedance should be less than 5400 Ohms/m, and longitudinal impedance for 11.4 giga-Hertz should be less than 2.5 Ohms/m.  Phase I will explore various gap geometrics and materials to optimize the gap design.  In addition, two novel design techniques will be introduced:  (1) the use of a new insulator technology in which the insulator is comprised of thin layers of standard insulating material alternating with finely spaced floating metal electrodes, and (2) the use of thin metal films to cost standard ceramic insulators.  These designs will lead to the manufacture and test of a prototype induction acceleration gap during Phase II.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The acceleration gap design should satisfy the technical requirements for the two-beam next linear collider (TBNLC) induction cells and should lead to significant reductions in the construction and operational costs of induction accelerators.

Both industries are struggling.  Agricultural revenues have been stagnant for almost 5 years, agricultural support and service industries have virtually disappeared from rural communities, and farmers have recently lost a major share of regional markets for barley and oats to Canadian products which benefit from transportation subsides.  Planned reductions in local timber production are expected to result in job losses as high as 50% over the next five years.  Forage-based agriculture offers excellent potential as an alternative enterprise to address both the economic and ecological challenges facing the area.  Several areas in the northwest have revitalized their economies by diversifying to forage products.  The area is well suited for the production of perennial grass hays and the recent development of prototype mechanized bale harvesting equipment compatible with the steep, highly erodible terrain in northern Idaho offers the foundation technology to support a rural development program to transition or diversify from cereal based cropping.  Recently over 2000 tons of local forage products, much of which was harvested by this prototype equipment, was sold for export.  The proposed research will make a comprehensive evaluation of the agronomic, equipment, economic, marketing and sociological issues associated with the feasibility of forage based agriculture as an alternative enterprise for rural development in northern Idaho.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"G&k Enterprises/black Ram","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Novel Protein Food Sweetener in Transomatically Modified Bovine Milk","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/171660","abstract":"We propose to validate the feasibility of expression in bovine milk of recombinant protein sweetener, following gene delivery by intramammary infusion of a replication defective viral vector.

Contemporary cognitive scientists agree that learning is embodied in the fluid medium of language; it is through language that we understand the world.  Language development can only occur in a rich social environment, where ideas are transformed, reformed, and dynamically changed by the participants in a conversation.  Youth with disabilities face particular difficulties in participating in the exchange of language within regular school settings.  Classroom settings which emphasizes individual student work rather than social interaction create few opportunities for students with disabilities to learn through the exchange of language.  Hardware and software which enable students to communicate are not, by themselves, an answer to this problem.  The culture of the classroom must also foster inclusion, providing disabled students with a role that contributes towards group goals and thus is valued by peers.  Cooperative learning activities can provide the structure needed to include these students in learning activities and increase communication between disabled students and their peers.  We propose creation of software that greatly increases the likelihood that students and teachers will meet with success in implementing cooperative learning activities.","agency":["Department of Education"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Imagen Multimedia Corp.on","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Thin-Film, Micron-Scale Transformers","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/187977","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"INTEGRATED MAGNETOELECTRONICS","reseach institution":null},{"title":"NOVEL ELISA METHOD FOR RISK ASSESSMENT FOR IDDM","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/188116","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Immco Diagnostics Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"IMPROVED METHOD OF MONITORING WATER FOR CRYPTOSPORIDIUM","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/188268","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"IMMUCELL CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Antibody Intervention in Cocaine Addiction","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/188282","abstract":"Currently there are no reliable pharmacologic treatments for cocaine addiction.

This project is aimed at reducing detector cost by addressing the following changes:  a new source for uniform Si wafers, a new approach to wafer polishing, and combining surface barrier and diffused junction contact technologies with an improved approach to oxide passivation.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  There are important markets for reliable silicon radiation detectors with lower cost, improved performance and better resistance to radiation damage.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"IntraSpec Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SFV&#039;S FOR STUDYING HORMONE RESPONSIVE SIGNALING","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/202376","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Invitrogen Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SELENOCYSTEINE TAGGING OF ENDOCRINE PROTEINS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/202384","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Invitrogen Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Field Energy Recoil Emission Technology (FERET)","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/202427","abstract":"Passenger safety concerns have prompted the FAA to elicit energy-sensitive neutron detectors which do not rely on the time-of-flight method and are suitable for use in explosive detection systems.

Also, calibration is infrequent and difficult, particularly for instruments stationed at inaccessible locations.  This project will develop  a miniature, electrically-modulated blackbody source weighing a few grams and occupying a fraction of a cubic centimeter. The heart of this source is an ion-beam textured filament which achieves temperature stability by heating and cooling on a time scale much faster than thermal diffusion. Its low thermal mass, near-perfect emissivity, and high temperature coefficient of resistivity cause it to precisely follow its drive current, permitting instantaneous feedback and temperature control. Its low power demand will permit remote, battery-powered operation under computer control. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The proposed device is a simple, light-weight alternative to traditional benchtop blackbody sources.

Producers have few chemically based options available for fly control because of insecticide resistance and loss of insecticides to regulatory concerns.  Proven biological and cultural control options provide alternatives to the use of insecticides and support existing natural enemies of the house fly.\n\nThis project is designed to provide producers with a renewable fly control option using an important natural enemy of flies associates with poultry houses.  The hister beetle, Carcinops pumilio, is a significant predator of fly eggs and larvae that occurs in large populations in well established poultry houses.  However, to avoid Salmonella outbreaks, poultry producers routinely fumigate houses between flocks.  This process destroys the beetle population which are then difficult to re-establish under natural conditions.  In contrast, the fly population re-establishes quickly usually resulting in a fly outbreak.  Producers could avoid fly outbreaks by artificially establishing a predatory beetle population in the poultry house before house flies become established.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"IPM Laboratories Inc ","reseach institution":null},{"title":"NOVEL ICG ANGIOGRAPHY TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT CNV","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/203517","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Iris Medical Instruments, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Compliant Plug And Socket Interconnector","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/203847","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Irvine Sensors Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Design and Specification for a Decision Support System for Emergency Services","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/204172","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"ISERA Group, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Rapid Hemoglobin F and F-Cell Quantitation","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/204226","abstract":"The goal of this project is to develop two simple sensitive and accurate immunologic methodsto quantify hemoglobin F.

The applicators will be developed specifically for use with that system, though somehardware and software modifications will be necessary to accept the new applicators. Phase I goals areto improve the performance of the SONOTHERM (R) system for treatment of breast and chest walllesions by examining (a) higher frequency applicator operation to limit penetration depth where indicated,(b) simultaneous multifrequency operation to provide depth of penetration varying over the face of theultrasound applicator array, and (c) improved means for coupling these new applicators for breast andchest wall treatments. Phase II will be devoted to the construction of clinical testing versions ofapplicators and other ancillary hardware and software developed during Phase I, and to conduct FDAsanctioned clinical trials at selected sites within the SONOTHERM(R) 1000 user base in the U.S. todetermine the safety and effectiveness of the new devices.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Labthermics Technologies, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SITE SPECIFIC MICROWAVE APPLICATORS FOR HYPERTHERMIA","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/212855","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Labthermics Technologies, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"New Organosilicon Maxillofacial Prosthetic Materials","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/212919","abstract":"This research will develop an improved maxillofacial prosthetic material based on a neworganosilicon polymer and monomer.

However, conventional solid polymer electrolytes have several drawbacks: (1) high methanol permeability; (2) low temperature operation, resulting in low catalyst activity at the anode electrode; (3) high electrosmotic drag number requiring intensive humidification and precise temperature control in order for the membrane to have high conductivity (especially at high current density); and (4) a water management requirement to prevent flooding of the cathode electrode.  This project will develop a new generation of solid polymer electrolytes by modifying available proton exchange membranes. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the

This project will develop a processing technology for active magnetic refrigeration devices which are being considered as candidates for replacements.  Brittle intermetallics will be processed into a \"tubular channels in solid block\" geometry.  Because the synthesis of such composites is extremely difficult, given their brittle nature, the conventional approach is to use a bed of intermetallic powders. However, numerical calculations indicate that alternate bed geometries, such as a solid block consisting of ~50-60 \u00bfm diameter channels or a series of stacked porous plates, hold promise for a 25% enhancement in operating efficiency. In this new approach, individual fibers are coated with the intermetallic and densified. The thickness of the matrix coating on individual fibers affords a convenient means to control the matrix volume fraction, and hence the porosity in the composite.  Then, the fibers are removed to yield continuous channels of constant pore size throughout a solid block. Alternately, the solid blocks can be sliced into thin porous plates which can be stacked appropriately for the highest efficiency.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  Magnetic refrigeration systems have been proposed for several applications from production of superfluid helium to comfort air conditioning.

During the initial heat up, radiant and convective heat is provided externally to the stack from an enclosure furnace and by sensible heat in the manifold regions of the stack via the process gases. Because both of these techniques involve external heating of the stack, the manifold regions melt while the active area is still a solid and sealing problems have resulted.

Membrane separation offers promise; however, most of the membrane plants installed for this application have been based on cellulose acetate membranes, which have a carbon dioxide/methane selectivity of 20.  If membranes could be made with selectivities of 40 or more, membrane separation would be a far more competitive carbon dioxide separation technique.

Mortality and morbidity are primary sources of economic loss for poultry and livestock producers.  Control of morbidity and mortality has generally been accomplished through the use of vaccines and feed antibiotics.  In spite of these protective measures, livestock producers still suffer losses due to mortality and sub-clinical disease problems.  At least half of broiler mortality is due to unidentified factors.  It is therefore critical that the young chick's immune system has a strong start early in life.  The leucine catabolite Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) has been shown to reduce mortality of broiler chickens, most of which was due to an abatement of unidentified early mortality during the first three weeks of age.  The objectives of this project would be to develop the use of HMB as an alternative to conventional drugs to control mortality in broilers.  The proposed study will use in vivo and in vitro techniques to determine if HMB improves immune function in young broiler chicks and thus, reducing unidentified mortality of the broiler chicks.  These studies would establish the basis for Phase II efficacy studies in poultry.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"METABOLIC TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"PHO BIOPOLYMER FOR CONTROLLED RELEASE","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/231017","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"METABOLIX, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Managing and Monitoring Health Care Delivery and Outcomes","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/231196","abstract":"We will ultimately structure a comprehensive medical information system based on efforts to standarpatient records and on technology developed for credit card size devices.

Preliminary experiments at a frequency of 10.6 GHz on Sitophilus zeamais in wheat and Tribolium castaneum in flour indicate that the selective heating of those insects increases at frequencies above 2.45 GHz and does not decrease monotonically as previously believed.  This implies that hitherto unobserved loss phenomena exist in insects and that high mortality can be induced economically at the higher microwave frequencies.  The proposed effort will extend the range of the previous experiments to confirm that a predicted optimum frequency exists in the microwave band and identify an optimum operating frequency within the constraints of CFR 47 (Part 2).

The Intelligent Fire Control (IFC) system offers improved reliability via redundancy, cross validation and triangulation.  The IFC also offers greater robustness and is less vulnerable to failures in a single sensor or in a control console.  While based on existing sensor hardware, continuous monitoring of the sensors' output allows the control algorithms to utilize the sonsors' proportional output rather than a fixed set-point (threshold) control.  By continuously performing situational assessment before, during, and after a fire event, the IFC is capable, via event-anticipation, of providing high sensitivity with a low false alarm rate.

Automated methods for detection and recognition of proteins on two-dimensional (2D) electrophoretograms are needed. Image processing techniques and expert systems have been tried, but these are computationally intensive, require heuristic rule bases, and cannot identify proteins from analysis of their constituent polypeptide chains. Artificial neural networks are easy to train and implement, and they should correctly categorize an almost unlimited number of proteins by their distinctive polypeptide patterns. We will develop a protein identification system based on neural net recognition of polypeptide distribution in 2D electrophoretograms. Phase I research will develop a demonstration system to examine electrophoretograms of an unknown protein and identify it. The effort is an extension of successful neural net research by ORINCON in such diverse fields as biomedical diagnostics, underwater acoustics, and fault detection. Phase II will incorporate data fusion techniques and an expanded set of known proteins to enable analysis of entire 2D electrophoresis biological samples. This would lead to development of a commercial package for automated protein analysis of 2D electrophoretograms. It easily could be modified to categorize other constituents (e. g., amino and nucleic acids) simply by retraining the net.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"AN INTELLIGENT PERCEPTION SYSTEM FOR AN AUTONOMOUS PLANETARY LANDER","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260680","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Advanced Materials and Construction for Preformed Traffic Loops","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260698","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Transportation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ORINCON","reseach institution":null},{"title":"DEVELOPMENT OF A RESONANT INFRARED PHOTOCONDUCTOR WITH UNIT QUANTUM EFFICIENCY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/260806","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"TechnoScience Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"PREVENTION OF HEPATIC STEATOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH TPN","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261009","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Orphan Medical, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"POLYMER MATRICES FOR ARTICULAR CARTILAGE REGENERATION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261019","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Orquest, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"An Expert System for Aquaculture Environment Control","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/261030","abstract":"This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I  project will explore the use of a fuzzy logic based expert system in a closed loop control system for nitrate removal (denitrification) from large aquaculture systems.

Rapid aneuploidy screening and sex determination will also assist situations involving newborns with multiple congenital anomalies or ambiguous genitalia, suggesting possible trisomy.

The filter, using a novel double-wedge holographic resonator in a vernier configuration, acts as a dispersive element. The combination of  a double-wedge resonator (to distribute the transmitted wavelength linearly across the aperture in a direction perpendicular to the filter's optical axis) and a vernier configuration (to ensure high effective finesse) will result in high (subangstrom) resolution across the selected bandwidth (from several to hundreds of nanometers) in the W, visible and IR range.

Ultracapacitors, because of their high rate of charge and discharge, are prime candidates for use as the load-leveling power source in electric vehicles. The most important parameter in determining the power and energy density of a carbon-based ultracapacitor is the amount of surface area accessible to the electrolyte. Although considerable effort has been invested in making monolithic carbon materials with the desired pore size distribution for use in ultracapacitors, no high performance carbon materials have so far met the cost targets. In previous studies, monolithic porous carbons have been prepared with the correct pore size distribution for use in ultracapacitors. Phase I will prepare cells to evaluate the power and energy densities attainable with the new materials, and estimate their cost in large scale production.

Therefore, TDA Research proposes to develop an emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) process capable of extracting selenium from agricultural drainage waters containing high levels of dissolved salts and concentrating it for subsequent treatment and disposal.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"TDA Research, Inc.

Stabilization of such wastes requires that contaminants of both kinds be immobilized effectively.  This project will develop a low-cost, low-temperature process for the concentration and stabilization of low level mixed aqueous wastes combining metals and radionuclides. The process is based on a low cost material that will be added to the aqueous waste stream. It can chemically bond with the metals and radionuclides, incorporating the contaminants within its chemical lattice structure. The contaminant doped material can be filtered out of solution, and can be thermally converted (at low temperatures) into a stable ceramic waste form.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee: The result should be a low cost process for the concentration and stabilizaltion of low-level mixed wastes containing metals and radionuclides.

Theassay is based on the activity of the cellular enzyme PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated). PKR is inducedby interferon and requires double-stranded RNA for activation. Activated PKR inhibits translation. Byinhibiting translation the cell stops viral replication since viruses are dependent on host translation. Someviruses (adenovirus, vaccinia virus, rotavirus, reovirus, poliovirus, influenza, and possibly HIV) haveevolved mechanisms to counteract this anti viral system by inhibiting PKR. The fact that manypathogenic viruses have inhibitors of PKR suggests that inhibition of this enzyme is important for viralreplication. In addition to its anti viral effects, PKR may also function as a suppressor of cell proliferationand tumor formation. Though tightly regulated, PKR apparently must be expressed and activated attimes during the cell cycle. In this context, activators of PKR may be useful as antitumorigeniccompounds, since activation could inhibit translation, perhaps leading to growth suppression of thetumor. The assay described here is a simple assay of PKR activity that can be adapted to identifyactivators of PKR, or to identify compounds that block viral inhibitors of PKR.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"RIBOGENE, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Identifying Novel Inhibitors of Viral Translation","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/293430","abstract":"Human rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses, hepatitis A viruses, and hepatitis C viruses are commerciallyhave established an in vitro screening system to identify compounds that inhibit translation of viruPhase I funding will be used to establish screening systems for coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus, aanalogous to a rhinovirus screening system already established.

The availability of these ultra-pure, less-acidic silica particles would permit superior separations of sensitive materials, particularly those of biological origins.

There are several applications for nondestructive assay of solid tritium-contaminated samples including environmental clean-up, routine assay of tritium handling equipment, assay of fuel elements used by fusion reactors including the proposed ITER reactor, and routine monitoring of fission reactor core materials.  Present technologies for the assay of medium-level tritium-contaminated solid samples either require substantial sample preparation or rely on surface contamination alone.  Preparation of solid tritium-contaminated samples poses the problem of further contamination and thus should be avoided if possible.  The only method that offers high sensitivity, accuracy and safety is calorimetry.  Since the average energy of tritium decay is well known (+/- 0.3%), the level of contamination can be directly inferred from the nuclear heating of the contaminated material.  The sensitivity of the technique improves tremendously at low temperatures (8 degrees K).  Fortunately, these temperatures can be reached using mechanical refrigeration rather than liquid cryogens, reducing the complexity and cost of the final system.  The device envisioned would be fully automated with a sensitivity of 1.5mCi (0.6GBq), an accuracy of 0.3% and a production cost of less than $40,000.

This project will determine the feasibility of using carefully prepared metal oxide films to provide a small, low-power, inexpensive and accurate means to measure NOx concentrations with high reliability and repeatability.  Conductivity measurements will be made of doped and undoped tungsten oxide (WO3) films exposed to known concentrations of NO and NO2 at a variety of temperatures, in a variety of oxygen concentrations, and in the presence of several interferant gases. Conclusions will be drawn as to the optimum temperature(s) at which each film should be operated to attain maximum sensitivity and selectivity, what role oxygen plays in the sensor response, and how selective the films are to NOx compared to other combustion exhaust gases.  Phase II efforts will focus on the development of a compact, rugged, inexpensive, commercially viable sensor to make in situ measurements of NOx concentrations in automotive exhaust streams.\n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: This project should result in a new generation of highly sensitive, highly selective, low cost and portable sensors with numerous immediate and long term applications within the federal government, automotive industry and other private sectors.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sensor Research And Development Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Advanced Silicon Carbide and Beryllium/Aluminum Alloy Integrally Cooled X-ray Synchrotron Mirrors","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304429","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"SSG, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"ADVANCED, WIDE FIELD-OF-REGARD, POINTING/STABILIZATION MIRROR WITH ULTRA-LIGHTWEIGHT, AFOCAL TELESCOPE FOR SPACE-BASED INTERFEROMETRY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304435","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SSG, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HIGH-PRECISION, LOW COST, SMART BEARING CONCEPT FOR ADVANCED CONTROL APPLICATIONS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304441","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SSG, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"CFRC SILICON CARBIDE MONOLITHIC SENSORCRAFT FOR NEXT GENERATION MICROSPACECRAFT APPLICATION","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304455","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SSG, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SILICON CARBIDE, LARGE APERTURE, PHASE ARRAY MIRROR TECHNOLOGY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304459","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SSG, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HYPER-SODAR","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304489","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sensor Technology Research, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A MONOLITHIC, ACTIVE PIXEL INGAAS NEAR INFRARED FOCAL PLANE ARRAY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304628","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sensors Unlimited, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR PHASE I: Tactile Array for Computer Interface","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304768","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sensortex","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Matrix Addressed Stress Sensors","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304776","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Sensortex","reseach institution":null},{"title":"MATRIX ADDRESSABLE VIBRATION SENSING ARRAY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/304778","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sensortex","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR Phase I: Development of a High Resolution Room Temperature Cylindrical Ionization Chamber Xenon X-Ray/GammaRadiation Detector","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/305117","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sentor","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR PHASE I: A Fiber-Optic, Simultaneous, Multi-Point Turbulent Kinetic Energy Rate Dissipation Sensor","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/305359","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SEQUOIA SCIENTIFIC, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Light Weight, Low-Cost, Dual Array Horizon Sensor Which Minimizes Radiance Errors And Mitigates Sun/Moon Effects","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/305467","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Servo Corp.

The joints will be located in high pulsed magnetic fields which will induce losses in the conducting media of the joint and in the superconducting cable itself. These losses add to the required refrigeration power and can in extreme cases threaten the thermal stability of the superconducting cable. Traditional approaches cannot take into account the three dimensional complexity of 1000+ strand cables and the nonlinearity of the conductivity.  This project will use asymptotic expansions to calculate the coupling losses in the superconducting cable.  A new algorithm will be developed to determine the position of individual strands within a cable of over 1000 strands.  The implementation of this algorithm will generate a new tool to aid in the design and analysis of joints in superconducting cables. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The ability to rapidly design and analyze electrical joints in superconducting cables will allow for more robust designs, decreased losses in magnet systems, and increased savings in refrigeration costs.

This is a result of the increasing demand for vaccines and the use of mammalian cells for some of the new, emerging biopharmaceuticals. Microcarrier beads in bioreactor systems are being applied as a large scale production method. SoloHill is developing a family of unique microcarrier products which are superior to those currently available. The overall aim is to develop a novel small microcarrier bead (38-63 micrometers) which will foster the aggregation of cells. This will encourage the use of microcarriers for conditions where higher cell densities have been shown to be advantageous. Specifically we will (l) demonstrate that higher cell densities can be achieved under conditions where extensive clumping occurs. We will characterize the bead-to-bead clumps on small (less than 63 micrometers) and large (150-212 micrometers) beads. And, we will (2) demonstrate that cells maintained under conditions of high cell density on clumped beads are metabolically active and produce higher levels of useful products including infectious virus than cells grown under conventional conditions (in which clumping is minimized).","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Solohill Engineering, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Fostering Rural Economic Development Using New Concepts in Snowmobile Trail Grooming","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311022","abstract":"Recreation and tourism have become a major part of the economic stability in rural areas over the past decade.  Revenues brought into small businesses by travellers into and through rural communities bolster and sustain the local economy.  Snowmobiling has become a major winter pastime and has the potential to bring a considerable influx of money into hotels, restaurants, markets and other establishments.\n\nThis study examines the economic impact and the technical and commercial feasibility of a new concept in snow trail grooming.  Unlike any other groomer on the market today, this concept enhances the physical properties of individual snow crystals resulting in a more durable trail surface.  Using the physical properties of these crystals to advantage also allows the trail to set up quite rapidly, minimizing damage by snowmobiles following closely behind the groomer.  An extended recreation season is anticipated along with a trail system more able to withstand poor conditions during winter, such as marginal snowfall or melting.","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Somero Enterprises, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Fish Grading/Sorting for Aquaculture Using Ultrasound Techniques","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311317","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Agriculture"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sonic Technologies, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A Distributed Multimedia Architecture","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311524","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"SOPH-WARE ASSOC., INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"A NEW COMBINED NOISE AND EMISSIONS CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE GENERAL AVIATION INDUSTRY","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311592","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Sorbent Technologies Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"MULTIMODAL (MRI/EEG/MEG) IMAGING SOFTWARE","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311783","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SOURCE SIGNAL IMAGING, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Indoor Production of Hybrid Striped Bass Fingerlings","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/311992","abstract":"A major constraint to the continued development of the hybrid striped bass industry is the seasonally limited supply of fingerlings.

Available heat- and flame-retardant garments significantly increase exposure, but use environmentally hazardous additives; additionally, further enhancements in flame-retardation are deisred.  Recent research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and elsewhere has demonstrated that ion beam treatment ofpolymers produces a heavily-cross-linked surface layer.  Treated surfaces are extremely resistant to chemical attack and form an impermeable barrier to evolution of volatile chemical groups from the material.  Additionally, recent developments in ion-beam-based coating technology now permit adherent metal coatings on fabrics.  The synergistic effects of ion bombardment and a metallic coating, which can be performed simultaneously in the same treatment system, would provide enhanced heat- and flame-retardant garments for fire fighters.  The metallic coating would reflect thermal energy, keeping the fabric cooler, and the ion beam bombardment would prevent evolution of volatile chemical moieties that contribute to the combustion process.  These treatments can be performed at low cost, do not produce environmentally hazardous effluents, and do not add weight or affect garment functionality, flexibility, or durability.  The proposed research would establish effectiveness of the surface treatments in tests of flame retardation.","agency":["Department of Commerce"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase

Poor literacy skills put this population at risk for severe employment problems - in finding and retaining appropriate employment; in communicating with supervisors and co-workers; in taking advantage of vocational education and, in turn, job advancement opportunities; and in performing job-related reading and writing tasks.  In every day life, poor literacy skills are also a significant barrier.  Simple tasks such as reading food and medicine labels, filling out medical forms, negotiating leases, buying a car or a house, applying for insurance, etc., become daunting tasks, often necessitating the services of hired interpreter.  Poor literacy also lessens the availability of public health, safety and social services information to this population, since that information is likely to be communicated in a written format.  And finally, inadequate reading skills minimize the effective participation of deaf adults in democratic processes as responsible, educated citizens.\n\nBy using computer-based multimedia that integrate pictures, animation, graphics, American Sign Language, and English text in a storybook format and within a context that is of interest to deaf adults, the teaching and learning of reading skills will be maximized.  Visually-rich computer-based programs will be used to complement existing teacher/facilitator-led literacy training or can provide learning, development, reinforcement, and practice reading activities independent of direct teacher/facilitator instruction.  The computer operating system will allow the programs to respond to each individual's needs and desires and to be tailored and expanded in relation to the individual's reading level and growth.  The programs will also be configured to provide on-going feedback to the user and facilitator.  The use of multimedia storybooks offers exciting prospects for literacy development, overcoming many of the reading obstacles deaf adults face today.","agency":["Department of Education"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Subtle Impact Software, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Development of Artificial Pinning Center NbTiTa Conductor for High Field Applications","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/320375","abstract":"41160\nSupercon, Inc.\n\nIn this project, a new approach to superconductor fabrication will be investigated.

This powder metallurgy approach allows the incorporation of a three dimensional, built-in dual function graded transition zone. The zone provides both the ability to accommodate interphase mismatch stresses and also prevents formation of brittle beryllium copper inter-metallic phases. The final attachment of the copper surface on the beryllium to the copper cooling structure of the reactor, would then involve less challenging copper to copper joining.

To make crosswell data acquisition cost effective, surveys must be acquired at greater well spacings than currently and receiver tools must be operated inside of production tubing, in order to avoid the cost and risk of pulling production tubing to run crosswell surveys.  However, the impediment to operation at greater well spacings and inside of production tubing is insufficient signal-to-electronic-noise ratio due to inadequate sensor sensitivity in current-generation receivers. This project will develop a strain gauge based borehole pressure transducer with 20 to 40 dB greater sensitivity than current-generation hydrophones based on mechanical amplification of strain.  Phase I will evaluate several feasibility issues and culminate with design and borehole testing of a prototype strain gauge based sensor. \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  In many areas such as West Texas, through-tubing crosswell operation could reduce well preparation cost by over 50% and reduce overall project cost to clients by 30 to 40%.

For example, it is crucial to know whether features observed in the recorded data are associated with the earth or with the data acquisition system.  Issues of particular interest are the radiation/reception patterns of downhole sources/receivers and their change with frequency, the generation of tube waves in the source well, the ability of tube-wave attenuators to effectively shield the receiver arrays from receiver-well tube waves, the types of wave modes that sources generate, the relative amounts of each mode in the total produced/recorded wavefield, and the ability of the receivers to operate through tubing.

The majority of these fish are reared in areas where infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) virus is endemic.  Unfortunately, mortalities are highest before the fish are fully immunocompetent, making vaccination a less effective tool in disease prevention.  Increasing the natural resistance of trout through genetic selection is the only feasible method for increasing productivity in the commercial sector and increasing survivability for fish destined for the natural resource.  Many animal husbandry industries have been successful in breeding disease resistant strains.  Although only limited selected breeding for disease resistance in salmonids has been performed, evidence exists for the heritability of resistance to several disease agents, including IPN.\n\nThis proposal seeks to use quantitative genetics to select for a domesticated strain of rainbow trout with substantial resistance to IPN.

However, material analysis using neutron beam techniques has a high demand on instrument time which is further exacerbated by the limited number of neutron-guide end positions. This project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a neutron bender-microfocusing optic that is constructed of a single piece polycapillary bundle. Glass polycapillary technology has demonstrated capabilities of efficiently transporting neutron beams, bending them, and producing high neutron intensity focal spots.   The neutron bender-microfocusing optic will enable the development of state-of-the-art neutron instrumentation along the length of neutron guides in locations previously unusable for end station techniques. The effective strength and availability of every reactor-based neutron source will be multiplied in a cost effective manner.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The neutron bender-microfocusing optic should lead to enhanced analysis capabilities.

However, their use for some energy ranges is limited due to absorption. For all applications, there is some loss of efficiency due to interactions of x rays or neutrons with the inner capillary walls.  Since the optics function as a result of multiple reflections, the ability to optimize reflecting materials would lead to dramatic improvements in capillary optic collection and transmission efficiency.  This project will combine two emerging technologies: multichannel capillary optics and low temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD ), to coat the inner glass capillary walls with thin films. Initially, nickel will be used for the coating material because it is the preferred material for neutrons and will provide improved x ray transmission efficiency for some commercially important x-ray energies.  A two-fold increase in optic transmission, for both neutron and x-rays, is expected.\n\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Improvements in capillary optic performance due to thin film coatings should increase sales of x-ray and neutron optics.

The high radiation fluxes characteristic of these experiments requires both extremely short decay times (to enable high timing resolution) and minimal contribution from long decay components (to prevent count pile-up). Barium fluoride is the most effective inorganic scintillator for such applications, largely because of the unusually rapid decay (0.6 ns) of its fast component.   Unfortunately, it has two major deficiencies: a long-lived slow component, which comprises over 85% of the total emission, and a particular sensitivity to damage by the very radiation it is measuring.  This project explores a new approach to achieving improved ultrafast scintillators for high-energy radiation detection.   A significant quantity (approximately 15 mole percent) of optically inert rare earth trifluorides are substituted into the basic alkaline earth difluoride lattice, and the host is doped with small amounts of other rare earths capable of d-f emission.   Most of the energy that now goes to the undesirable long component should be diverted into a much more rapid emission in the 1-10 ns range, enhancing both timing resolution and radiation hardness without reducing the contribution from the fast component itself.   The validity of the approach will be confirmed through spectroscopic and kinetic measurements on specially grown specimens, and  the expected performance improvement will be assessed.  \n\nAnticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee:  The project will develop a scintillator material whose performance exceeds that of BaF2 in all three critical ways: enhanced timing resolution, reduced background, and greater radiation hardness. This will not only provide nuclear physicists with a superior measurement tool, but lead the way to improved materials for medical and industrial uses as well.","agency":["Department of Energy"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Alem Associates, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"LUALO3 CE, A NEW HIGH-PERFORMANCE PET SCINTILLATOR","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/355405","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Alem Associates, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"The Application of Advanced Technology to Traffic Enforcement","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/355625","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Transportation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Anacapa Sciences","reseach institution":null},{"title":"OPTIMAL DESIGN OF LAMINAR FLOW WINGS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/356116","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Dynaflow Inc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE FOR END-TO-END ELECTRO-OPTICAL SYSTEM MODELING","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357246","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Lambda Research Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"HUMAN IMPLANTATION OF A TELEMETRIC ICP SENSOR","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357279","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Lifesensors, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"AUTOMATED FLOW CYTOMETRY ANALYSIS FOR LEUKEMIA DIAGNOSIS","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357300","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Management Science","reseach institution":null},{"title":"AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF MULTIPARAMETER FLOW CYTOMETRY DATA","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357302","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Management Science","reseach institution":null},{"title":"SBIR Phase I: Multimedia for Learning Structural Biochemistry","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357386","abstract":"N/A","agency":["National Science Foundation"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"SCIENCEMEDIA, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"BIOLOGICAL STENTS FOR TREATING BPH","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357434","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"MMTC, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Fiber Optic Nozzle Tip Monitor for Agricultural Sprayers","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/357715","abstract":"Concerns about health and environmental hazards associated with chemical spraying, as well as the rising cost of farming, madate that chemical application becomes more efficient and increasingly precise.

Magnetic switches are best suited to low energy/pulse applications, becoming bulky and less cost effective at >100J/pulse energies.  Si (or GaAs) switches have low voltage hold-off and are limited to 1kJ/pulse at > 10kHz rep-rate, with voltage hold-off at the 0.5-1MV level.

A low inductance solid-state switch capable of switching 100 kV, 100kA at a high repetition rate would be desireable.

The key innovation is dramatic enhancement of the conversion efficiency in the OPA by resonantly feeding back the unconverted pump beam. Pump feedback is accomplished with a resonant ring cavity built around the OPA.  Theoretical OPO conversion efficiencies (pump to signal + idler) are near 30% without feedback, and between 75-80% with feedback.  System efficiency is examined further through a preliminary design study on the diode-pumped drive laser. Alternative materials such as Yb:YAG are more effective storage media than Nd:YAG>  thus, there is tremendous potential for reducing the diode laser requirement, and thus the cost.  The Phase I objectives are to demonstrate efficient conversion in a pump feedback OPA through experimental and analytical efforts, and define the architecture of the diode-pumped drive laser.  In Phase II, the drive laser, seeded OPO and OPA are further developed and integrated into a single tunable system to be delivered to the Air Force at the end of Phase II.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Aculight Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Compact, High Pulse Rate, Mid-Infrared laser","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/70593","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aculight Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"CW Mid-Infrared Tandem OPO Source","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/70634","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aculight Corporation","reseach institution":null},{"title":"The Application of LIBS to the Detection of Lead in Soil and Paint","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/70839","abstract":"This proposal describes the development of an instrument based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the detection of lead in paint and soil that will have both military and commercial applications.

In contrast to conventional static approaches, our concept is based on active image tracking. It allows for simultaneous image processing, parameter estimation, and filtering. High target signature variability captured by optical, infrared, millimeter-wave and microwave radar acoustic sensors, etc. substantially diminishes the effective- ness of these technologies in automatic target recognition systems. In this proposal, we address related problems of effective representation and processing of target signatures subject to random fluctuations. Our approach is to represent randomly perturbed dynamically evolving images using the emerging mathe- matical technique of wavelet descriptors for stochastically deformable templates. The wavelet descriptor has many desirable properties including multiresolution representation, invariance, uniqueness, stability and spatial localization. Real time processing of randomly evolving target signatures is seriously restricted by limitations on availability of communication channels, bandwidth length, computer power, etc. One way to circumvent these difficulties is the dynamic distribution of resolution, so that the maximum resolution windows are applied to a small number of the image landmarks. To achieve this goal, we propose a new method of template deformation tracking and prediction, based on the nonlinear filtering approach. Specifically, we use a new fast spectral algorithm for nonlinear filtering. By separation of observations and parameters, this algorithm shifts the main bulk of computations off line. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate that the recent breakthroughs in wavelet-based image descriptors and fast nonlinear filtering make feasible the real-time implementation of our approach.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Aegir Systems","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Integration of III-V Semiconductor Optical Sources with Electro-optic Polymer Waveguide Devices Using Micromachined Reflective Elements","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/78749","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Aegis Technologies Group, Inc., The","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) System Design and Operation","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/79187","abstract":"Aerovironmet Inc.  proposes to undertake Phase I of DDARPA SBIR 962-080 to develop and assess operational utility of micro air vehicles (micro AV) for unique military applications.

The approach provides uniform and stable cooling of the entire blade, with the evaporated coolant flowing as vapor to the blade root, where it condenses while transferring heat to low pressure air flow.  The key to achieving uniform evaporative cooling is establishment of a liquid flow, driven by the centrifugal acceleration field of the turbine, filling numerous transverse capture shelves on the inside blade wall surfaces.  It cascades from the inner shelf outward, with vapor from each returning to the root region for condensation and recycle.

The key feature is that each reporting node in the system is a transceiver that acts as independent data transfer switch. Each transceiver will automatically adapt to network fault problems, data errors, and change data routing patterns without human intervention. Radio packet transmnissions will permit encryption and the use of anti-jamming techniques.

Key component areas to consider are photonic true time delay devices, lightwave transmit-receive beamforming manifolds and monolithic microwave/opto-electric integrated circuit T/R modules for the active aperture.

This proposal presents a program for developing a novel patterning system that not only delivers high resolution over a large image field, but alos produces high exposure throughput and eliminates the shortcomings of conventional systems. It can deliver a throughput . 12 sq. ft./min (i.e., more than an order of magnitude higher than before) with 0.2 mil resolution. These results are achieved by a novel scan-and repeat exposure mechanism which enables seamless exposure of large substrates with a resolution of a few microns.

Because the survivability of any TMD asset is greatly affected by the nature of its environment, there is a critical need for a way to simulate these effects in real time. Using the proposed technique, the Government will be able, for the first time, to render fully photo-realistic, real-time environments in its TMD simulations. The Result will be the generation of better simulations that allow valid survivability studies to be performed. This Phase I outlines a 6 month program to prove the viability of the ARMA technique for enhancing TMD simulations.

Brimrose Corporation, in collaboration with the Center for Photonic Technology at The University of Southern California and Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, has in recent years produced ZnTe:V crystals and reported photorefractivity in this material for the first time. Our preliminary study indicates that ZnTe is an outstanding photorefractive material with a sensitivity range expanding from 0.6um to beyond 1.3um. Available ferroelectric oxides and sillenites do not have required efficient response beyond visible wavelengths. Moreover, these classes of materials lack the sensitivity and speed of response necessary for real time applications at low laser power levels. Semiconductors such as GaAs and CdTe are demonstrated to have a sensitive and fast response; however, their energy band gaps limit their use to wavelengths longer than 0.9um. The large band gap III-V and II-V semiconductors such as GaP, CdS, and ZnTe have the potential for sensitive operation in the wavelength range of O.57um to 1.3um. A comparison of the figures of merit n3r/Er, corresponding to the electro-optic index change per separated charges suggests the highest sensitivity in ZnTe. The superior sensitivity of ZnTe with respect to other materials is now confirmed through our preliminary experimental findings. During Phase I, the major emphasis will be placed on the purification of the starting material, determination of optimum doping concentration of vanadium for operation in the wavelength range of 0.8um to 0.85um and the growth of photorefractive ZnTe Crystals.

During previously SBIR-BMDO funded work, Brimrose Corporation successfully fabricated Hg1-xMnxTe detectors with cutoff wavelengths of 15.5 microns at 77 K, RoA performance in excess of 0.02Qcm2 and minority carrier lifetimes of 1 microsecond. The bulk Hg1-xMnxTe crystals were grown using the travelling heater method (TJM). Further purification of the starting materials and processing techniques along with a substantial reduction in diode thickness is expected to improve these parameters such that the minority carrier lifetimes approach the Auger limits. Therefore, we propose liquid phase epitaxial growth (LPE) of Hg1-xMnxTe layers on lattice matched Hg1-xMnxTe substrates via the tipping and dipping techniques to fabricate very thin n on p photodetectors. We will also investigate extensive methods for further purification of the starting materials and the solutions necessary for LPE growth.

These dyes have extraordinary Stokes shifts and, when bound to biological macromolecules or molecular assemblies, high quantum yields.  The second approach exploits the newly emerging technology revolving around luminescent lanthanide chelates and cryptates.

To alleviate these problems it is proposed to develop new optical diagnostic systems which combine global laser light sheet droplet flow visualization with quantitative fluorescence and Doppler measurements of fuel spray density and velocity.","agency":["Office of the Secretary of Defense","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"COMPLERE INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Prediction of Remaining Useful Life of Aircraft Components Using Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) Data","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/130767","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Composites & Mechanics, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Neural Geometric Engine Using Cortical Information Processing","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/130903","abstract":"CST proposes research and development of an artificial neural geometric engine designed according to a Lie group model of cortical visual information processing that can rapidly determine affine difference between two images.

Neurobiological research in 80s has found that the receptive fields in primate's visual cortex compensate dynamical changes of retinal images of objects by its own dynamical warping.  This suggests an straightforward and efficient approach to invariant object recognition.  Motivated by the computational strategy of biological vision system, CompuSensor Technology (CST) Corporation has developed a novel method compensates image scale, rotation, and translation variance by a direct affine transform of Gabor basis function controlled by a Lie group processor.  We propose to develop a method of incorporating CST's scheme to an artificial intelligence system for landmark recognition and place determination with invariance regarding to rotation, scale, translation.  The method of using a straightforward geometric compensation controlled by a Lie group processor overcomes shortcomings of current state of the art object recognition methods:  It greatly reduces redundant template storage and matching in terms of views; It avoids the multiple response problem of the Fourier-Mellin transform method.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"COMPUSENSOR TECHNOLOGY CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Dual Affine Transform Method and Extended Kalman Filter for Target Extraction and 3-D Position Location from Video Images","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/130907","abstract":"We propose to develop a dual affine transform method and an extended  Kalman filter for extracting target from video images, and locating its three  dimensional (3-D) position in GPS coordinates.

Our approach is based on a new class of methods which eliminate all need for computational mesh of finite elements.  This is accomplished by covering the computational domain by a cloud of points and using these points for discretiz- ation of the mathematical problem.  We will introduce h-andp-adaptivity, where new points will be adaptively added and removed in the domain, and the local order of approximation will be adaptively selected to assure high accuracy of approximation near the crack tip. This new approach will eliminate classical restrictions on modeling of crack propagation imposed by the finite element methods, where cracks can only propagate along element boundaries.  Moreover, by introducing adaptiv- ity, it will allow for accurate resolution of stress around the crack tip and tracking of crack propagation.  Importantly, the method will allow for a high degree of parallelization on MPP machines. In Phase I we will extend the meshless computational capabilities exist- ing at COMCO to hp-adaptive modeling of crack propagation problems in two- dimensional domains.

Anechoic chambers are characterized after initial construction to determine the quiet zones where the creation of free-space conditions is being attempted. When systems under test (SUT) are placed in the chamber, degradation of the quiet zone occurs and generally characterization of the chamber must be re-accomplished. Chamber characterization with the SUT is usually the most time-consuming and a very costly part of the test activities in anechoic chamber facilities.  This Phase I proposal is to determine the feasibility of developing an accurate computer software model to simulate and predict the RF environment of anechoic chambers. The analytical tool will have capability which has application for characterization of any anechoic chambers containing any size SUT.

With integration of other codes which provides accurate scattering models for the chamber anechoic surfaces, an enhanced A2P3 will provide an all digital model measurement tool to characterize the noise level, locate quiet zones, and hot spots in large anechoic chambers with or without SUT installed. This capability will greatly enhance anechoic chamber testing by accomplishing characterization with greater accuracy, automating characterization tests, and substantially reducing the overall characterization time and cost.

Current state-of-the-art demining techniques vary in both approach and equipment; however, they generally involve hand tools and mine detectors.  All techniques currently share two traits:  they are manpower intensive and result in considerable risk to the personnel involved.  Improvements in demining are sought which will result in reduced cost and acceptable timelines while achieving near perfect removal/neutralization and operator safety.  Concept Engineering Group, Inc.

This safe excavation technology allows precise and controlled digging and is ideally suited to uncovering a buried mine.  Supersonic air jets are extremely effective at penetrating and dislodging most types of soil, but are harmless to buried objects.  Based on its work, CEG proposes to develop a man portable, supersonic air jet, backpack demining system.

Ingestion of concentrated vortices in propellers can lead to undesirable noise in submarines, while the encounter of aircraft wakes with following aircraft presents a significant safety hazard that limits capacity at all major U.S. airports. This proposal involves an assessment of the feasibility of mitigating adverse vortex wake effects using aero- and hydrodynamic control surfaces actuated via smart structures technology. This will involve a combined computational/ design analysis effort focused on identifying changes in the spatial and temporal load distribution on lifting surfaces to promote vortex breakdown and other destructive instabilities that can deintensify the vortex wakes of aircraft and submarines. The computational analysis will apply proven tools in a study of the sensitivity of core structure and vortex wake hazard to modifications of the trailing vortex wake, while the design studies will build on modeling tools recently developed for the analysis of aerodynamic surfaces actuated using smart materials. The overall objective will be the identification of a technically feasible system using deflectable surfaces that can address current challenges in vortex wake deintensification through the promotion of altered wake structure. Anticipated Benefits: Vortex wake hazard drives aircraft landing separation at major airports and the delays resulting from excessive spacing cost the US economy several billion dollars annually in lost time and jet fuel. Even relatively modest reductions in current spacing would substantially increase effective airport capacity.

Compliant force devices can develop the forces  necessary to spread multi-line towed arrays.  There are two crucial components to a successful compliant foil towed army system.  The first  component consists of the compliant foils, which provide sufficient force to spread the multi-line  array.  The second component is the passive feedback system that provides proper dynamic  stability of the entire towed system.  Both components must be designed to interact compatibly  with each other, and offer robust and reliable performance over the entire operational envelope of  the towed array.

The Rotary-Piston combusiton-ignition engine design uses six double-ended pistons have centrally located drive pins reciprocating the pistons twice per revolution, providing the equivalent of a 12-cylinder 4-stroke having a mere seven moving parts and delivering power-to-weight ratios exceeding 1:1.  Incorporating this high speed drive unit with the latest developments in mechanical and electronic VSCF technolgy will allow government platforms to replace gasoline-powered gensets with safer, less-volatile diesel units without sacrificing protability or specific fuel consumption performance.  Numerous commercial applications will also benefit from development of an ultrlite diesel genset, including marine, aviation, construction and recreation.  The proposed Phase I research effort will perform preliminary design and provide proof of concept through the development of a test-stand prototype to evaluate drive unit performance and VSCF integration. results will be compared with state-of-the-art genset capability and estimated cost of production to determine the significance of the innovation.","agency":["Department of Defense","Army","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"E.P.

This  recycling technology is designed to gasify heterogeneous waste streams, generating  a gasified or liquid syn-fuel product which can be tailored to the particular  characteristics of the end use equipment. This proposed SBIR program evaluates  the feasibility (Phase I) and demonstrates (Phase II) the EER SBR process for  recycling Navy ship generated Plastic Processor product (mixed plastics waste)  into a gaseous or liquid phase syn-fuel that can be blended with conventional  fuels used in existing Navy fuel fired equipment. The Phase I feasibility study  includes an environmental regulation review, Navy base and waste characterization,  treatability testing (to help define technical issues for the Phase 11  demonstration), conceptual process design, case study economic evaluation, and  concept of operation description. It is anticipated that the results of the  Phase I effort will indicate that the SBR process is capable of recycling the  Plastic Processor product into a syn-fuel compatible with existing Navy  equipment.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"EERGC CORP.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Investigation of Molded Photovoltaic Case","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/157667","abstract":"Portable electronic equipment, whether military or civilian, now typically contain rechargeable batteries.

When the nozzle temperature is high, physical and chemical processes will erode even the most refractory materials such as tungsten, carbon and carbide ceramics.  Modern hybrid rockets pose especially challenging problems because of higher combustion temperatures and potential mixing instabilities.  Because such erosion degrades rocket performance significantly, there is high payoff in developing non-eroding materials concepts for use in both tactical and launch vehicle rocket motors.    Cooling is a known effective means of eliminating nozzle erosion in liquid propulsion rockets, but the traditional implementation of cooling is complex and impractical for other rockets.  This project investigates a simple configuration for a cooled composite nozzle in which transpiration cooling arises from the volatilization of phase-change materials (PCMs) that saturate a porous structural matrix.  The proposed matrix is a novel non-woven refractory fiber structure that allows control of porosity, strength, conductivity and capillary retention.  The proposed concept is expected to outperform phenolic ablators because there are numerous PCMs condidates that can provide adequate cooling when the vapors transpire at the surface and the structural matrix is far more resistant to erosion than the char arising from ablators.   Phase 1 will evaluate a series of composite materials with different matrix material configurations and different PCMs including a metal and a salt.  Small nozzles will be tested in a laboratory hybrid rocket configuration for burn times lasting tens of seconds.  Modeling will address PCM vapor flow and thermal penetration in the nozzle throat area.  The benefits for specific rocket motor applications will be assessed.","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Energy Science Laboratories, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Cryogenic Variable Conductance Heat Pipe","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/158441","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Defense","Missile Defense Agency","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"ETA,llc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Energetics of Late Chemical Reactions of Metals in Nonideal Underwater Detonations","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/158951","abstract":"Although nonideal explosives are rapidly becoming the workhorses of the military services and industry, they are, as yet, poorly understood.

This increases the cost of the ultimate fiber because preform cost often represents more than 50% of the fiber cost.  Additionally, since the preform rod has a specific volume, the length of the fiber that can be drawn is limited.  This increases the number of optical couplers and amplifiers needed to achieve a very long signal path from the relatively short segments drawn.  This also adds potential variability in optical performance and an increased probability of mechanically weak points in the fiber system.  Both these aspects further increase the system cost.  These problems can be reduced by developing a novel process in which glass precursor coatings are formed on a continuously moving filamentary core of material which is removed or becomes a part of the ultimately formed optical fiber.  Optimizing the process to yield strong, low loss optical fibers of ultra long length should significantly lower the cost of optical fiber systems for various military and commercial applications for communications.  The sol-gel process also should provide the opportunity to develop specialty fibers/sensors for environmental and other applications with improved reliability and reduced cost.  The proposed Phase I study involves a thorough investigation of state-of-the-art processing for applying sol-gel glass coatings to host core filaments and vitrifying the coatings into high quality optical fibers, comparable in mechanical and optical properties with fibers obtained by the current preform method.

These range from very fast lifting line schemes which only include the simplest incompressible, inviscid modules for rotor-blades and wake, to full CFD compressible, inviscid potential free-wake methods which are moderately fast, through full compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes methods for rotors and bodies, which are very expensive and have only been used to date for parts of the rotorcraft problem.  Currently, there techniques are only used in widely different studies, typically by different engineers, due to the widely different computational speeds and performances of the schemes.  A systematic approach is described to combine these techniques into a \"multi-level system\".  The basic idea is that each method will be implemented in a code module which will use essentially the same input and output and appear to a user as almost the same code. Then, the user can easily and quickly do computations for the same problem with different modules, with varying levels of accuracy and speed.  This will be very important for rotorcraft engineering design and analysis where a large number of cases (several hundred) must be computed for parametric and optimization studies. Currently, oly very simple, fast codes are used for these studies which lack important aerodynamic effects.  With the proposed multi-level system, an engineer will be able to still do a large number of fast runs, typically on a workstation.  However, after every set of fast runs, a single, higher fidelity run will be made.  The difference in the results between the simple and higher fidelity runs will be used to modify the subsequent set of simple, fast runs so that they include the effects that the simple code, by itself, would have neglected, without greatly increasing the computational time.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"FLOW ANALYSIS, INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Sensing Surface Temperature of Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) Materials","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/168004","abstract":"FluoreScience, Inc. is proposing an innovative thermometry   technique for measuring the surface temperature of ceramic matrix   composites (CMCs) that are critical to the success of new, high   performance turbine engines in the Air Force IHPTET program.

ECM hardening is achieved by operating the RF sensor at the 60 GHz molecular oxygen (O2) atmospheric adsorption peak.  Short-range, radar proximity sensors operating at this frequency would be virtually impervious to stand-off jammers due to the relatively high atmospheric attenuation of the jamming signal, combined with the favorable range advantage enjoyed by the fuze sensor along with the difficulty in producing high levels of RF jamming power at this frequency.  Utilizing Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, all RF and millimeter-wave circuitry, including the antenna, will be integrated into one or two MMIC chips of minute dimensions.  The 60 GHz fuze sensor described in this proposal utilizes frequency-modulated, continuous wave (FMCW) radar techniques in order to remain compatible with existing sensor signal processing circuitry and also to minimize production costs.  The RF circuitry consists of a high-power voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)/buffer amplifier MMIC operating at 20 GHz and producing approximately 0.5 watts of RF power, which drives a second MMIC chip consisting of a Schottky-diode tripler, a passive antenna diplexer, a homodyne receiver mixer, and a single-patch microstrip antenna.

The Rayleigh wave is bound   to the surface of the wheel, enabling measurements on curved and   other irregularly shaped surfaces.  Also, the Rayleigh wave   approach can discriminate between tensile and compressive residual   stresses and eliminate the effect of texture on the residual stress   determination.  Initial measurements have demonstrated these   capabilities on non-ferrous and ferrous metals.  The result of the   proposed research program will be a field portable inspection   system based on a portable computer that can be operated remotely   by a single user.  This will enable the stress levels and their   variation with subsurface depth to be determined rapidly and the   data to be stored for later analysis.  The results obtained from   this instrument will enable the fatigue life of the aircraft wheels   to be predicted and incorporated into appropriate design models.

All three members of this proposal team have been involved over the last 15 years with programs emphasizing different aspects of composite ISO shelter design, fabrication, and testing.  The primary factor inhibiting the routine usage of composite shelters by the military has been their high acquisition cost.  An approach to composite shelter design that from the outset uses an integrated design/build team approach to assure that shelter configurations are chosen to take maximum advantage of automated composite manufacturing technology is required to reduce cost.  During Phase I the proposal team will design composite ISO shelters using three different philosophies - a part-for-part replacement of the aluminum ISO shelter components currently in military service, a minimum weight design with little regard for cost, and a balanced cost/weight design emphasizing component tailoring for automated production technology. Pultrusion, filament winding, RTM, compression molding and braiding will all be evaluated for potential applicability to cost effective fabrication.

Although the wavelet-based representations offer more versatility in time-frequency localization than other Fourier methods, they tend to have  poor localization especially near high frequencies.  To eliminate this difficulty, we propose a technique for analyzing signals of time-varying characteristics using adaptive wavelet packets, which facilitates identification of arbitrarily localized spectral characteristics.  For nonstationary signals that contain varying distribution of spectral energy, the analysis must adaptively select filters of different localization properties.  Wavelet-packets designed through digital filter banks offer arbitrary tiling of the time-frequency domain.  Herley et al.

The devices produce a prompt detonation wave in the main fill explosive which may continue to propagate or it may fail due to comer turning effects. Calculation of detonation propagation or failure is an essential part of flyer plate booster design.  In order to calculate detonation failure, the reaction zone of the detonation wave needs to be resolved.  This is impractical in conventional hydrocodes because the entire explosive must have the same fine grid as the reaction zone. Available reactive flow hydrocodes use bum models that consist of simple global kinetics that are calibrated by experiments performed at pressure that are much lower that found in detonation failure.

In this way the fine numerical resolution can be confined to the detonation reaction zone.

Before long these requirements will exceed the capabilities of batteries and a new system will be required.  Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have the capabilities needed to fill that need.  PEM fuel cells are capable of generating electricity efficiently, with high power to weight and power to volume rations and excellent load following.  PEM fuel cells are superior to other fuel cell types for small portable applications. The active electrolyte is a solid polymeric sheet instead of a corrosive liquid supported in a solid matrix.  The PEM stack is capable of operating at ambient temperatures and pressures and requires no preconditioning or clean-up of the air supply.  Most current fuel cell stacks require significant support hardware for air supply and fuel gas handling and humidification.  The proposed system eliminates all of this.  The use of monopolar design with an ambient air cathode has eliminated the need for an air handling system.  The use of a common hydrogen manifold for the entire stack both simplifies construction and eliminates the need for any gas handling on the fuel side beyond a step-down regulator for the hydrogen supply.  This rugged, innovative design can supply the power needed in a small, light weight unit.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Biodegradable Bioadherent Microcapsules for Orally Administered Sustained Release Vaccines","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219449","abstract":"Traditional parenternal vaccines have many limitations which pose problems for both military and civilian vaccination programs. Parenternal vaccines must be administered by trained medical personnel, booster doses are generally required to obtain maximum protection, they are usually only effective against a single organizm and most require refrigeration.

The proposed work utulizes recombinant Fasciola hepatica eggshell proteins to form antigen containing microcapsules which will be used as an orally administered vaccine.  The recombinant Fasciola hepatica eggshell proteins were selected as microcapsule constituents specifically because of their natural biodegradable and bioadherent characteristics.

Further, several different organisms could be encapsulated separately but administered at the same time ia and outer capsule which contained the BBM antigens.

As the air-breathing propulsion materials (such as titanium and nickel aluminides) used in Navy aircraft jet engines are becoming harder and more brittle, they are more difficult to machine using conventional methods. ECM is believed to be a feasible method to solve these problems since it is a relatively nontraditional fabrication technique based on controlled removal of material by electrochemical dissolution of the work piece. In ECM, the metal removal rate is independent of the relative hardness of the part of the tool. Electrolytes currently in use include aqueous solutions of salts or strong alkali hydroxides which have a number of disadvantages, such as, low conductivities, corrosion, gassing, and bubbling problems. In this work, it is proposed to apply molten salts, e.g., mixed alkali hydroxide melts, as advanced electrolytes for ECM systems so as to improve their functionalities in coping with the ever-increasing use of new super alloys. Feasible molten salt systems and their physical and electrochemical properties will be identified and compared.

Often these contaminants migrate into the ground water where they pose a serious threat to aquatic systems and to human health.  The remediation of soils and ground water is usually accomplished by first pumping the contaminated water to the surface.  A number of methods are available to remove heavy metals from water including precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange or adsorption.  Each of these processes have limitations and it is expensive to treat the large volumes of water that are brought to the surface.  The proposed project concerns the development of a new electrochemical metals recovery process for the treatment of contaminated ground water and waste water.   The process has the potential to be applied below the surface in an extraction well, thereby eliminating the need tobring the contaminated water to the surface.  In Phase I, a bench scale system will be evalulated using simulated ground water spiked with heavy metals.  This will provide the technical foundation for conducting a pilot-scale field demonstration in Phase II.  Anticipated Benefits:  The anticipated result of this project is the development of a versatile process for the separation and recovery of metals from waste water and industrial process streams.  The method will be used for the restoration of contaminated soils and ground water.  The process has a wide range of industrial uses, for example, in metal plating and finishing, ore processing and mining, and in the manufacture of photographic films, jewelry and printed circuit boards.  The process can be applied for the removal of toxic metallic wastes from military and private sector sites.","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"LYNNTECH INC.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Electrochemically Deposited High Temperature Tolerant, Corrosion Resistant Composite Coatings","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/219465","abstract":"the objective of this proposal is to develop a low cost coating  that provides increased corrosion resistance for application on  automobile exhaust system components subjected to high temperatures  as well as corrosive coastal environments.

Existing and emerging technologies are based on various combinations of thermal, photothermal and catalytic processes in oxidative or reductive environments.  They suffer from emission of toxic substances, employment of inadequate UV light sources, presence of catalysts and disposal/liability problems.  These drawbacks render these processes complex and expensive.  This Phase I proposal offers a novel low-temperature technology designated Excimer Photo-Oxidation (EXPO) for treatment of dilute gaseous effluents contaminated with chlorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons.  The most innovative aspect of the EXPO technology is the employment of a unique, recently developed very powerful Excimer UV lamp (not laser).  Excimer lamps combine selective and intensive UV radiation, which until now, only Excimer lasers could provide, with the relative simplicity and affordability of conventional UV lamps.  This intense UV emission selectively initiates dissociation of targeted molecules, enhancing chemcial reactivity and leading to effective oxidation at or near ambient temperature.  The end products are inorganic acids (HR, HCl) and environmentally benign products CO2, H2O.  The primary objective of Phase I is to experimentally and computationally demonstrate feasibility.  To achieve this goal, a four-task work plan is proposed.  It consists of (1) design and contruction of two (2) photochemical reactors: (static with Excimer laser, flow with Excimer lamp); (2) experimental investigation; (3) chemical modeling; and (4) cost analysis. Successful completion of Phase I will determine the optimal operating conditions for a pilot-scale prototype, and will provide a technical foundation for a comprehensive Phase II R&D leading to a field demonstration followed by commercialization in Phase III.","agency":["Department of Defense","Air Force","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"M.L.

Although spent lubricants can be considered a   valuable renewable resource, less than 10% of the worldwide supply   is actually re-refined into high quality lubricant basestocks.

Although stricter   environmental regulation will continue to limit these disposal   options, increasing the amount of re-refined lubricants beyond   current worldwide levels will be difficult to achieve without   incurring significant cost.  The disadvantages of conventional   re-refining technologies combine to simply render this technology   useless outside of highly populated metropolitan areas where large   quantities of spent lubricants are generated in a centralized   location.  Re-refining technology that can be employed on a small   scale is required throughout most of the US but up until now has   simply been unavailable.

Other driving forces are fuel economy, and NVH (noise vibration, and harshness). The first two (emissions and fuel economy) are government mandated while the NVH is a mandate of the marketplace. All of these driving forces and goals will ultimately affect the piston design used in the engine In gasoline engines, as well as natural gas engines, hypereutectic aluminum silicon (>12%) alloyw are normally used due to their excellent wear resistance. However, they have limitations in the overall temperature to which they can be exposed thus resulting in a limitation in the combustion temperatures in the engine. If higher temperatures are desired in future engines, advanced materials will be needed to extend these limits. Carbon-Carbon materials were developed for the aerospace industry and have historically been ignored for large volume commercial applications due to their high costs. However, in the last 5 years, the advent of a number of new processing routes to form carbon fibers has reduced the prices of production significantly and this ha resulted in the engineering viability of commercial products using these materials. C-C composites also exhibit superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. In this Phase I effort, MMI will demonstrate the feasibility of producing C-C pistons by developing all the manufacturing sequences necessary for commercial production.

The bipropellant fuel combustion temperatures are between 3000 \"approx\" 3500 C.  The conventional thrusters and exit nozzles made of niobium alloys have a maximum operating temperature limit of 1600 C.  A regenerative cooling technology is normally used to keep the wall temperatures below its limit.  This type of cooling is not effective for smaller engines because of the lower propellant flow rate and great wall area/flow rate ratio.

In the device manufacturing processes, at present, it is not possible to determine if the final product is successful until all steps and materials have been incorporated.  Since this entire manufacturing process can take up to 12 weeks to complete, much time and effort is spent on components which may ultimately prove to be defective.  Current defect rates are in the order of 80% and are attributed to defective FPA chips/die.  As a consequence, the availability of fully functional FPA modules is limited, and the price of those produced is unacceptably high.  The Hall effect technique, particularly in conjunction with the van der Pauw theorem, is the most frequently used method of screening chips.  In this technique at least four electrical ohmic contacts must be made to the semiconductor.  This technique is labor intensive and frequently causes mechanical and electrical problems that result in inaccurate and non-repeatable results or damage. Furthermore, the measurement of carrier concentration as a function of position on the slice (mapping) is impossible since the Hall technique provides only the average value of the carrier concentration for area enclosed by the electrical contacts.  For detector arrays, carrier concentration uniformity or doping homogeneity is necessary for uniform array operations.  Any nonuniformity in the starting material would show up as a nonuniformity in the detectivity of each pixel in the detector array.  The approach described in this proposal requires no physical contacts, is not labor intensive and can map electronic properties, such as carrier concentration and mobility, of a chip with high spatial resolution thereby identifying small areas of electronic nonuniformity that could not otherwise be found by conventional screening methods.

Increased efficiency will lower the   emission of harmful products for direct improvements in   environmental quality.  A major barrier to commercial and   industrial uses of C-C composites is high cost. A rough   analysis performed for this proposal indicates that over 50% of   the cost of some C-C composites is associated with conventional   densification that requires processing at high temperatures in   nonoxidizing environments.  As a result, simplifying and   increasing the efficiency of the densification could result in   as much as a 33% reduction in the final cost of simple   high-production C-C components.  An effective approach for   lowering the densification cost of C-C composites would be to   minimize or tally eliminate the need for nonoxidizing   high-temperature processing.  In this vein, the approach proposed   here is based on impregnating carbon fiber preforms with sugars of   appropriate characteristics and paralyzing these at low   temperatures in air to form the carbon matrix.  Preliminary work   at MSNW has proven that sugar densification by multiple cycles   of melt impregnation and low-temperature pyrolysis in air is   effective to a significant degree.

Two problems are frequently encountered in the synthesis of nanoparticles: (1) carbide and nitride nanoparticles of reactive elements are invariably contaminated with oxygen, and (2) multicomponent materials are usually non-stoichiometric. Our collaborators at SUNY Buffalo have developed a patented Laser Assisted Molecular Beam Deposition (LAMBD) process, which is capable of solving both problems.  Our goal in this program is to develop a LAMBD nanopowder production module, integrate it into our existing Nanopowder Production System, and thus expand our powder production capabilities. The LAMBD process, which is an unique combination of plasma/laser ablation techniques, gas flow modulations, and molecular beam expansions, has so far been used only for the deposition of high quality films on substrates. In Phase I, we will determine the process parameters affecting nanopowder production, synthesize test quantities of powders, and characterize them. In Phase II, we will incorporate the LAMBD module into our Chemical Vapor Condensation (CVC) production system to demonstrate production of nanopowders of nitrides, carbides, and multicomponent materials in sufficient quantities for our collaborators to use for evaluation purposes.

Each sonobuoy carries a differential GPS receiver that continuously tracks its location with instantaneous accuracies of 2-4m.  The actual tracks of all sonobuoys are established by smoothing their position data with regression fits.  Acoustic data relayed from the bouys to a central station is processed to suppress background interferences, recognize the surface impact signature, and triangulate to a most probable impact point through hyperbolic fixing using multiple buoy pairs.  A centroid algorithm that weights buoy contributions and over-determining hyperbolic crossings by their measured validities establishes the final location choice.  All of the hardware and most of the software algorithms have been developed and tested in similar applications.

The Tangential data collection method has already proven it's advantages in the Rocket Motor System.  It leads to faster scanning rate, smaller data files, larger contrast due to flaws and easier yet faster data analysis.  The Tangential scanning technique will use the natural circular symmetry of the CDI casting for data collection.  In the Tangential Scanner system, the data is naturally collected at the tangent of various diameter circles.  Thus the data is naturally collected through equal amount of steel material.  This leads to mostly equal x-ray signal detected by the detector system.  In such a scanning scheme, abrupt or even slow change in the x-ray intensity is easy to recognize.  The difference in the detected x-ray intensity is usually either due to a flaw or a known feature in the casting.

To achieve such an objective, robust adaptive nonlinear control schemes are being proposed so that hard nonlinearities such as friction, striction and backlash in the driving mechanisms can be accounted for and reduced through feedback.  During the Phase I efforts, various models for such hard nonlinearities will be investigated and simulation studies will be carried out.  Futhermore, recently developed algorithms by the principal investigator will be applied to compensate for hard nonlinearities such as backlash and variable friction due to aging of the parts and changes in the geometric configuration of the system.  It is long understood that hard nonlinearities arising in the driving mechanism of the turreted weapon systems and in most high accuracy industrial machinery are the major causes of their performance degradation.  These nonlinearities are difficult to model and therefor control.  Among the approaches in handling these problems is the employment of direct drive technology, and addition of new actuators such as those that incorporates smart materials, and the use of magnetic and hydrostatic bearing.  Another approach is through better modeling of these fundamental nonlinearities and thereafter more advanced control designs, we propose here to study different models for there nonlinear effects and to reduce their effects on the system performance through advanced nonlinear control designs may also be utilized for direct drive systems and systems including additional actuators such as ones based on smart materials (e.g., piezoelectrics ceramics).

Much progress has been made in epitaxial thin film growth of nitrides using metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) during the last decade. These efforts are hindered by the lack of lattice-matched substrates. Most studies have employed sapphire substrates for GaN although there is a large mismatch between these materials. GaN films on sapphire substrates have a great number of threading dislocations which propagate up to the surface. Such highly defective material suffers both from low carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Although low temperature, pulsed laser operation has been achieved, the defects may also act as optical scattering centers, preventing the demonstration of a low threshold CW injection lasers operating at room temperature. Recently, LiAl02 and lithium gallate, substrates with improved lattice matching to GaN, have been developed. In preliminary experiments, GaN grown on LAO by ECR MBE at 800 C, exhibited optically pumped stimulated emission. However, MBE is not suitable for production applications and, in addition, LAO and LGO cannot withstand the high temperatures used in conventional MOCVD. NZ Applied Technologies has achieved promising results for GaN growth at low substrate temperatures using a novel MOCVD-based growth process. This approach can yield high quality GaN on LAO or LGO substrates at substrate temperatures which are compatible with these new materials.

The Stokes parameters are chosen to be intensity, percent of polarization, and angle of the plane of polarization.

Water vapor is the most significant and most highly variable of greenhouse gases.  It is also the most significant and highly variable atmospheric constituent in the formation of weather and in the transfer of atmospheric heat.  Yet it remains one of the most poorly characterized of meteorological parameters.  In spite of their high cost, inaccuracy, and noncontinuous nature, radiosondes (RAOBs) are still the common method of profiling atmospheric water vapor. There are no all-weather remote sensing technologies in existence or in development that can remotely profile water vapor; other know technologies are defeated by the presence of cloud.  The inversion method proposed herein involves profiling the power spectrum received at the surface of a pressure broadened microwave water vapor emission line.  A prototype profiling radiometer is the built and operated in parallel with NWS (RAOB) releases.  We further propose to apply heretofore unexplored mathematical inversion methods to retrieve the vapor profile from the instrument observables.  We will employ several experts in several fields of mathematical inversions, including neural networking, iterative, and seismic inversion methods.  These methods will be tested for accuracy under a broad spectrum of atmospheric conditions using data from RAOB soundings as well as synthetic profiles.

The combination of a large diameter air gap, high coercivity rare earth magnets, and a high ratio of magnet length to pole pitch permits torque densities in excess of 1600 ft-lbs./ft(3) without the added complexity and inefficiency of a gear reducer.  SatCon has developed and analyzed a conceptual design of a permanent magnet which is roughly 10 inches long by 23 inches i diameter.  Initial analyses indicate that it can achieve 300 kW over an operating speed of 400-3600 rpm, while maintaining an efficiency of better than 93% down to 400 rpm.  At 400 rpm and 300 kW the machine is producing 5280 ft-lbs. and, therefore, is achieving a torque density of 2200 ft-lbs./ft(3).  the high efficiency of the motor and the absence of a gearbox allows overall efficiency of the motor and electronics to exceed 90% over the entire speed range.  At speeds above 400 rpm the same power is achieved at even better efficiency, since the required torque falls off.

The driver technology to be developed is based on high pulse rate Insulated Gate, Bipolar Transistors coupled with nonlinear magnetic pulse compression and new fractional-turn output transformer technology developed at SRL. The IGBTs act as a primary commutator and are used to switch the I joule of energy stored at 500 VDC in the primary energy storage capacitors to form 5 usec pulses. Two stages of nonlinear magnetic pulse compression and a fractional-turn output transformer are then employed to compress these pulses to the 20 kV/80 nsec pulses required to charge the peaking capacitors at the plasma discharge load. Circuitry will also be installed to increase the efficiency of coupling electrical energy to the rapidly varying load impedance represented by the plasma discharge. The all-solid-state driver will be designed to operate continuously at repetition rates up to 10,000 pulses per second and to have an operating lifetime of greater than 100 billion shots. In Phase I, Science Research Laboratory (SRL) will make the necessary modifications required to increase the pulse rate of an existing SCR-commutated copper vapor laser driver to 10,000 pps. These modifications will include replacement of the SCRs with IGBTs and upgrading the pulse compression modules, the thermal control systems and the driver trigger system. This modified driver will then be tested into a load circuit which simulates time-varying plasma discharge loads. The driver will be tested to full performance specifications and any performance deficiencies will be corrected. Phase I will culminate in the final engineering design of a prototype all-solid-state driver which will be fabricated and tested at SRL and then delivered to a selected Navy site in Phase II.","agency":["Navy","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"SCIENCE RESEARCH LABORATORY, INC","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Advanced Ultraviolet and Electron Beam Curable Systems for Aircraft Applications","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/299247","abstract":"Radiation curing using Ultraviolet (UV) Light and Electron Beams (EB) offer advantages for a variety of aircraft structural and non-structural applications.

At present, message-passing systems like PVM or MPI are the most widely used software systems for parallel computing, both for defense applications and for applications in the commercial and industrial sectors. Message passing is conceptually quite straightforward and should be relatively easy to apply. Unfortunately, however, the fact that today's message-passing systems are based entirely on the use of subprogram libraries, rather than on language-level constructs, makes them much harder to use than they should be, particularly when handling heterogeneous or unstructured data and computing environments. In this work we will develop suitable precompiler technology to handle many details of message-passing systems automatically, while still preserving the ability of sophisticated users to control the low-level details when that is required. We proposed to investigate language-level front-end systems that will interface with widely-used message-passing products like PVM or MPI to reduce the burden on users by providing, among other things: much cleaner and more intuitive syntax; semantic support for compile-time or link-time error checking; and automatic handling of many general situations at run time. ANTICIPATED BENERFITS: This project will lead to tremendously increased use of message-passing systems by making them much easier to use. By eliminating many programming complexities, compiler-level enhancements allow quicker development of programs that are more correct and run faster. Products based on this work will enable commercial and industrial firms to gain far greater benefit from parrallel computing, and to do so faster, with less-specially-trained personnel, and at far lower cost than with current library-based message-passing systems.","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"Scientific Comput Assoc","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Real Time Parallel Data Fusion Tool","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/300015","abstract":"Extracting knowledge from the vast amount of rapidly-evolving data handled by image processing programs, situation assessment and decision support systems, and many other applications important to the BMDO mission is a demanding task requiring powerful computer hardware and appropriate software architectures.

This effort is aimed at the near-term deployment of ensuing technologies on a low-cost helicopter engine.  The effort will be embedded in the T800 engine commercialization project led by the Allison Engine Company.  The reasons for the high cost of engine controls are two fold: first, redundant components increase costs; and second, engine-specific implementation and designs increase non-recurrent costs.  Hence, to lower the cost of control systems, we need to reduce the number of redundant components and make the control adaptable to a broader range of engine applications.  The approach taken to reduce cost while maintaining operability is to develop the control systems based on software (or analytical) redundancy.  Software redundancy is a model-based control/monitoring paradigm, which is consisted of an embedded, real-time, physical model of the engine and a smart, flexible, robust decision mechanism.  The goals of the model-based control are to provide functional operations in case that the primary digital control channel fails (or is switched off), and to perform fault identification, fault accommodation, and life usage manegement for the engine.

The current system designed by Bell Textron uses five nonself-adaptive filters in the frequency range of 2.3-5.5Hz on SAHRS and VYROS outputs and pilot stick control inputs to remove the effect of unwanted structural modes. The filter frequencies are scheduled with airspeed and conversion angle but not with respect to gross weight. The purpose of designing a self-adaptive notch filter is to compensate for changes in frequency due to effects such as gross weight and to achieve narrow filters with minimal phase lag. The use of a System Identification approach based on the Stochastic Realization Algorithm (SRA) is proposed. SRA has been shown to be very effective in estimating the parameters (frequencies, dampings, mode shapes) of structural modes of aircraft and flexible structures using measurement of outputs only.

At low frequencies and long wavelengths, most of the scatters are in the Rayleigh scattering region and their RCS is low, which enables foliage penetration.  However, this also results in a small number of large scatterers on target of interest.  Automatic Target Recognition and Detection (ATR/D) using FOPEN SAR needs to utilize higher dimensional features such as polarization, absolute intensity, angle-diversity, frequency-diversity and other multi-kernel attributes of SAR imagery.  In addition, since the resolution at low frequencies is degraded, super resolution techniques hold great promise for enhancing ATR performance.  There is also a great need for dimensionality reduction in the design of ATR algorithms since the use of higher dimensional attributes results in multidimensional target templates.  In this proposal, we describe an efficient ATR approach based on the use of eigentemplates which have been found to be very successful in face recognition and have been shown recently to be close to full template matching in SAR ATR performance.  The specific Phase I technical objectives are: 1. aquisition of UWB FOPEN SAR simulated and real data. 2. Resolution enhancement using multidimensional Super resolution algorithms. 3. Development of Eigentemplates and associated ATR algorithms using higher dimensional target attributes. 4. Testing and evaluation of Supper resolution and ATR algorithms on simulated and real data.

The present high fabrication cost of laser diode sources is caused mainly by the cost of packaging, because of the variety of packages needed for each diode and application.

This optical bench must support all components (telescope, scanner, lasers, resonator, beam steering optics, and detector) while maintaining critical alignment of the single-mode, heterodyned laser system.  Specifically, the structure must maintain sub-0.1 milliradian level tolerances in the presence of thermal loads, gradients and drift, aircraft vibration, and varying gravitational loads; all while meeting strict weight requirements.  SSG's success developing light weight, inherently athermal optical systems from bulk SiC forms the basis for the proposed innovation: creation of the DUAL LIDAR optical bench from a new fibrous weave SiC form (a continuous fiber reinforced composite).  This weave SiC retains the advantages of the bulk material:  low CTE, high thermal conductivity, and excellent thermal stability (>12X aluminum); while adding high damping (>10X aluminum), ultra-light weight (density = 60% of aluminum, modulus >2X aluminum), and excellent fracture toughness (can be dropped on a cement floor).  Furthermore, the weave offers near-net shape fabrication for significant cost saving potential.  In Phase I, SSG proposes to analyze, design, fabricate, and test a prototype optical bench/structure for the DUAL LIDAR system.  This innovation will enable the airborne DUAL LIDAR system to satisfy rigid, ultra-light weight, thermally stable and durable airborne and UAV applications.  Anticipated Military Benefits:  LIDAR military applications: bomb drop, precision air drop, gunship ballistic winds correction, shipboard sensing and avoidance of turbulence.

This technique is much improved from the traditional ultrasonic/acoustic technique. The object need not be contacted, the excitation is much gentler than that required in a contact test, and the whole approach lends itself to automation. Anticipated Benefits: This effort will provide a strong foundation for high resolution and high speed sensors for determining attachment integrity of micro-dimensional material layers. This technology can be adapated to numerous applications such as thick film & thin film, deposition processes for microelectronics, joining of metals and other joining processes with unknown micromechanical properties.

Negative electron affinity property of the diamond surface had been reported previously. However, this exceptional super-high brightness electron emission behavior is believed to be a new mechanism due to the composite structure of cesium, oxygen and carbon. The high turn-on voltage has been a major hurdle for the field emitter to be widely used in Flat Panel Display (FPD) market. Experts anticipate that the field emitter FPD will overwhelm today's Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) FPD market if the turn-on voltage gets down to less than 5 V/micron. SKION's new findings will provide a breakthrough in the FPD industry. This novel structure is believed to be formed due to the characteristics of SKION's unique patented ion beam technology; capable of controlling flux ratio of cesium/carbon and the energy of the carbon ion beam.  Furthermore, SKION's ion beam technology is applicable over large areas. The behavior of super-high brightness electron emission will be investigated in this SBIR Phase I in collaboration with Dr. J.

Use of PDT in conjunction with laser hyperthermia to treat cancerous tissue offers potential advantages over PDT alone. The proposed diode laser instrument would provide optical power at two different wavelengths (separately or simulataneously), one in the red (690 nm) for PDT and the other in the near-infrared (~800 nm) for laser hyperthermia. The instrument would incorporate two monolithic, independent, linear arrays of high efficiency, state-of-the-art, strained-layer, quantum well lasers each coupled to a common fiber-optic delivery system. Unlike present commercially available argon-pumped dye lasers, which are extremely large, inefficient, and expensive, the proposed laser system will be sufficiently small, portable, and cost-effective to permit easy installation and operation in hospitals and clinics. The prototype instrument will be evaluated by conducting combined PDT and laser hyperthermia on mouse tumors at the Massachusetts General Hospital's Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine. Anticipated Benefits: Successful Phase I and Phase II programs would lead to commercialization of a highly versatile instrument for either separate or combined photo-dynamic therapy and laser hyperthermia treatments.

In recent years, advances in solid-state imager design have made high-speed video a viable alternative to film. High speed video, however, is not a fait accompli. The imagers are multi-port chips, with high bandwidth outputs at each port. The analog signal conditioning and digitization stages of the multiple high speed signals occupy a large circuit board area. Also, the digital clocking requires significant amounts of board space. We have confronted these issues in our prototype 640 x 480, 500 frame per second high speed camera. Such cameras are needed in government and industrial applicatons that call for a rugges, small package. Multi-chip modules provide a means to braoden the use of high speed video. During Phase I, we will research the market and cultivate a working relationship with a key customer. The MCM, with a high speed imager and associated multi-port processing and digitization, will be specified and suppliers will be chosen. An initial MCM design will be fabricated. During Phase II, the MCM will be developed and integrated into a high-speed, high-resolution (i.e., 500 @ 1000 fps) digital video camera.

For every technology based advantage provided, there is an added training requirement. Additionally, the ARNG utilizes a variety of vehicles, such as the MlAl, MlA2, M2AI, M2A2, CEV, and others. The training needs of the ARNG center upon the mastery of sophisticated systems in a dynamic, complex environment. A comprehensive reconfigurable system must address all of these factors.

A wide angle (180 degrees) image is used as the input and portions are displayed stereoscopically based on the head position of the operator.

This calibration method relies on measured motion of geometrically well-defined structure with known dynamic behavior.  Using an array of reference accelerometers, the global motion of a calibration platform is defined.  Unlike traditonal calibration techniques, where a single DOF is excited while cross-axis DOF are assumed negligible, this method forces and measures all six DOFs.  For low frequency calibration, a platform designed to act as a rigid body over the frequency range greatly simplifies post processing.  Simple geometric transformation matrices allow extrapolation of the motion at any site (corresponding transducer-under-test (TUT) location) on the structure.  However, at high frequencies, rigid body assumptions will not hold. Accordingly, a modal model of the calibration platform defines the structure's deformations over his extended frequency range.

The proposed program addresses our approach for (1) making the necessary calibration measurements during pre-mission checkout, (2) updating candidate parameterized polarization  models using the calibration measurements, and (3) extracting the depolarization corrections from the model using a simple algorithm.","agency":["Army","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1996,"firm":"TOYON RESEARCH CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Single-Element GPS Antenna with Adaptive Anti-Jamming Capability","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/336190","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Air Force","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"TOYON RESEARCH CORPORATION","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Ultra-high Dielectric Constant Dielectric Materials","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/336365","abstract":"NON-NUCLEAR APPROACHES ARE SOUGHT FOR HIGH ENERGY DENSITIES FOR SPACE POWER SYSTEMS.

To combat this threat requires portable, low cost sensor systems capable of detecting a variety of dangerous materials at extremely low concentrations.  Such a technology could be used for detection of explosives, poisonous gases, concealed weapons and illegal drugs.  TPL has developed piezoelectric devices and self-assembled monolayer chemistry techniques that result in sensors able to detect low ppb levels of specific analytes at a cost of approximately $10 per sensor.  Although these characteristics are promising, the range of potential threats and environments requires a sensor system that is extremely selective to ensure detection and avoid false alarms.  TPL proposes an instrument and software system that would permit a single array of approximately five sensors to be able to detect a wide range of materials.  Selectivity would be achieved with an array of sensors, each sensitive to a chemical moiety rather than a specific analyte.  The response of the array would be calibrated using a software approach to the recognition of relevant analytes under actual environmental conditions.  Anticipated Military Benefits/Potential Commercial Applications of the Research and Development:  A simple, accurate, highly automated sensor system for detection of explosives, poison gases and other materials would have widespread application for the U.S. military, local police forces, and industrial concerns,  It could also be used to provide critical information on the level of fugitive emissions at industrial manufacturing facilities, waste storage sites, and hazardous waste cleanup sites.

Existing design rationale models suffer from the lack of integrating rationale with the design process.  The integration is crucial for the domain of software design due to its complexity.  A model for design rationale capture and its related knowledge base is developed in this research.  It provides method to decompose and organize design and reasoning information.  A primary goal of this model is to enable the designer to analyze, capture and reuse different types of design knowledge.  The proposed rationale model converts a design problem into a problem structure and a corresponding product structure.  The problem and product structures are represented by linked aggregate hierarchies of instances of various classes which together encode the expert design knowledge and navigational indices of an arbitrary design problem.  This allows problem space model to provide rationale at any level of the design and relates all these rationale classes to one another.  The proposed rationale model has four contributions. First, it identifies different types of design knowledge that are generated during a design process and describes a framework to represent them.  Second, it describes a mechanism by which the rationale of a decision can be provided at any time and at any level of the design.  This allows the designer the flexibility to enter design rationale at the problem definition level, during problem solving, and/or after problem solution is complete.  Third, it provides an evaluation and explanation facility enables the designer to judge the quality of the final design artifact based on the rationale used in the design.  Fourth, the model incorporates the concept of design patterns into its definition, therefore enabling designers to use past proven experiences and expert knowledge in their design activities.  This not only shortens the development time and eliminates design pitfalls, but it also ensures a high quality product design.","agency":["Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Tri-state Research Corp","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Affordable Manufacturing of Complex Shape Metal Matrix Composite Structures of High Speed Rotocraft","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/338649","abstract":"An affordable processing and manufacturing system for production of fiber reinforced complex shape metal matrix composites (MMCs) is proposed.

Increasing the density and controlling the size, shape, and velocity of the fragments can greatly increase warhead lethality and standoff capabilities through an approach called a self-forging fragmenting warhead, which combines explosively formed penetrator and fragmenting munitions technology.  Further extension of this technology requires the development of small EFPs that produce fragments with high ballistic coefficients and stability, meaning high sectional density, fin-stabilized projectile formation.  Tungsten is one of (if not the) most attractive materials for this purpose, being low in cost and having a higher density than depleted uranium or tantalum.  However, while finned EFPS have been demonstrated by wave-shaping in tantalum, copper, and steel, conventional tungsten and tungsten heavy metal alloys possess insufficient ductility below 1000 C to form high L/D finned projectiles.  As a result, current tungsten self-forging fragmenting warhead designs have poor material yield (material actually formed into the penetrator rod or ball), and no high L/D or finned tungsten EFPs have yet been developed.  In this Phase I project, Ultramet proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing tungsten heavy metal composites having sufficient ductility for finned EFP formation, and fabricating tungsten EFP designs showing fin formation.  Specifically, micron and submicron grain size tungsten heavy metal composites will be developed having optimal, non-equilibrium microstructures in nickel-iron and iron matrices, and initial EFP lens designs will be developed leading to finned tungsten.","agency":["Department of Defense","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Ultramet","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Tungsten Composite Fragmenting Warhead","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/341209","abstract":"N/A","agency":["Department of Defense","Air Force","Department of Defense"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1996,"firm":"Ultramet","reseach institution":null},{"title":"Reactor Technology for Aqueous Phase Catalytic Oxidation of Organics","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/341570","abstract":"An investigation of the efficacy of low temperature aqueous phase catalytic oxidation for the destruction of organic water pollutants of significance to the U.S. Armed Forces is proposed.

Expected benefits will be improved ATR algorithms and new techniques for mapping terrain under trees, as well as potentially measuring some parameters related to tree height and density.  Sensors capable of producing such data are expected to become operational in the near future for both military and civilian applications.

Some research into polarimetric aspects of the data have been carried out, as well as investigations into UWB ATR applications.  To exploit the new dimensions of this data, we impose important calibration requirements on the sensor data.  Specifically, we will investigate the use of calibrated phase and amplitude information available in the polarimetric scattering matrix measurements.

While MCTs are known to possess significant forward drop advantages over IGBTs or MOSFETs, their switching behavior is much more complex. Conventional PWM switching of MCTs at high frequency leads to significant switching losses due mostly to a current tailing problem during device turn-off. Zero-voltage switching or zero-current switching can be achieved with a resonant link inverter. This can greatly reduce the switching losses. However, this approach leads to higher voltage and/or current stresses on the devices.

The camera will use a noncryogenic low noise, high-speed silicon CCD focal plane array (FPA), capable of being synchronously gated, for the 3-D imaging. An advantage of this 3-D imager is that the critical parameters of range, position, and velocity are read out directly with a minimum of algorithmic processing required.

The displacement of the sensing elements due to the loads imposed on them will be sensed with a fiber-optic sensing technique.  Because the bearings are stiff, the displacements are small and require amplification. The small displacements of the fiber-optic bearing-balance will be sensed and amplified with a modified and upgraded commercial fiber-optic sensor, which is currently being used in a fiber-optic pressure transducer developed at QUEST.  Orientation sensing will also use the fiber-optic displacement measuring technique. This will be accomplished by sensing a reflector ring located off center to the bearing axis.
