ALTERNATE SCANNING SYSTEMS THAT DIRECTLY DETECT THE FLUORESCENCE ARE SLOW. A NEW IMAGING SYSTEM IS PLANNED TO MEASURE BOTH THE MASS AND THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF THE SAMPLE. SUBSTANTIAL INSTRUMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS APPEAR POSSIBLE IN FLUORESCENT EXCITATION, OPTICAL LIGHT COLLECTION AND IMAGING, AND DETECTOR PERFORMANCE. REPLACINGFILM WITH A CHARGE-COUPLED ARRAY DETECTOR (CCD) NOW APPEARS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CCD PERFORMANCEAND THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGER ARRAYS AT LOWER COST. THOSE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE STAINED DNA/GEL SYSTEM WILL BE MEASURED, WHICH MUST BE WELL-CHARACTERIZED TO DESIGN A HIGH PERFORMANCE IMAGING SYSTEM AND TO ESTIMATE ITS PERFORMANCE WITH USEFUL ACCURACY. AN ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF A SPECIFIC DESIGN WILL EXAMINE THE INCREASED ANALYTICAL ABILITY TO QUANTITATE THE MASS OF DNA IN A BAND THROUGH IMPROVED FLUORESCENCE MEASUREMENT, AND WHETHER THE OVERALL MEASUREMENT TIME CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENED BY ACHIEVING HIGH DETECTOR SIGNAL-TO-NOISE AND BY MORE FULLY AUTOMATING THE MEASUREMENT.

THE PUU WILL BE CONVERTED INTO TUBE AND SHEET CONFIGURATIONS UNDER CONTROL- LED AND DOCUMENTED CONDITIONS. BULK AND SURFACE PHYSIO- CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION WILL BE APPLIED TO ASSESS CHANGES INDUCED BY THE CONVERSION PROCESS, PACKAGING, AND STERILIZA-TION. A DOCUMENTATION PACKAGE WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE PRMTHAT WILL CONTAIN THE CHARACTERIZATION RESULTS AND HANDLING AND STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS. DURING PHASE I, A LOT OF POLY- TETRAMETHYLENE (PTMO)-BASED PUU WILL BE SYNTHESIZED AND CHARACTERIZED. PILOT QUANTITIES OF PRM IN SHEET AND TUBING CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE FABRICATED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF USING PUU AS REFERENCE MATERIALS. STERILE, PACKAGED SAMPLES WILL BE CHARACTERIZED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF GAMMA RADIATION AND TO ASSESS TIME-DEPENDENT SURFACE CHANGESIN THE PRM. DURING PHASE II, PRM WILL BE FABRICATED FROM POLYETHYLENE OXIDE (PEO)-BASED PUU AND POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (PSX)-CONTAINING PUU TO PROVIDE PRM WITH A RANGE OF SURFACE FREE ENERGIES/HYDROPHOBICITIES. STERILE, PACKAGED SAMPLES OF THESE MATERIALS WILL BE CHARACTERIZED. SELECTED CHARAC- TERIZATION WILL BE CONDUCTED AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO DETERMINE IF THE BULK OR SURFACE PROPERTIES OF THE PRM HAVE AFFECTED BY STORAGE.","agency":["Department of Health and Human Services"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase II","year":1987,"firm":"Mercor Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"QUEST: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXPERT SYSTEM TESTBED","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/230159","abstract":"WHILE MEDICINE GENERALLY AND HEALTH CARE SPECIFICALLY HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT UPON COMPUTERS FOR DIAGNOSTICS, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT, AND EVEN NEW CAPABILITIES (E.G., CAT SCANNERS), ONE AREA THAT HAS NOT DERIVED THE FULL BENEFIT OF MODERN COMPUTING IS QUALITY ASSURANCE.

THE DEVICE WILL BE A PORTABLE, SELF-CONTAINED, MICROPROCESSOR-CONTROLLED SYSTEM WELL SUITED FOR USE IN A DERMATOLOGIST'S OFFICE. THE UNIT WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING TAILORED THERMAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN SKIN TISSUES BY DYNAMICALLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTROLLING THE ACOUSTIC FREQUENCY AND POWER OUTPUT OF AN ULTRASOUND TRANSDUCER AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER BATH THAT COUPLES THE ENERGY TO THE BODY. PHASE I OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS CONCEPT BY FABRICATING A CLINICALLY USEFUL TREATMENT APPLICATOR AND TESTING ITS PERFORMANCE IN BOTH INSTRUMENTED PHANTOMS AND PSORIATIC TISSUES. KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PHASE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSDUCER CAPABLE OF EFFICIENTLY RADIATING AND WITHSTANDING CONTINUOUS, HIGH-POWER OUTPUTS OVER THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF 5 TO 10 MHZ. A NOVEL DESIGN HAS BEEN CONCEIVED AND ITS ACOUSTICAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES SIMULATED USING A PROPRIETARY TRANSDUCER MODELING PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY ULTRATHERMICS.
