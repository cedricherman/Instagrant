SEVERAL DIFFERENT ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COCHLEAR IMPLANT DEVICES. RELIABLE ELECTRICAL OPERATION HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN VITRO FOR OVERTEN MONTHS IN ONE CONNECTOR. HOWEVER, THE CONNECTOR DESIGN IS EXCESSIVELY LARGE FOR PRACTICAL HUMAN IMPLANTATION. WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP A LOW PROFILE CONNECTOR 0.74\" LONG X 0.62\" WIDE X 0.120\" THICK. THE CONNECTOR FEATURES A FOUR PIN PLATINUM-IRIDIUM CONTACT DESIGN, PRESSURIZED SILASTIC(R)SEALING GASKETS, A POLYSULFONE BODY MATED VIA A TITANIUM COMPRESSION MECHANISM AND TEFLON(R)-INSULATED PLATINUM-IRIDIUM LEADWIRES. THE DESIGN IS OPTIMIZED TO MINIMIZE PIN TO PIN ELECTROLYTIC CORROSION, A FACTOR WHICH CURRENTLY LIMITS THE LIFE OF SUCH CONNECTORS. EIGHT OR TWELVE PIN DESIGN CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH MINOR SIZE INCREASES. SHORT TERM EXPERIMENTS UNDER THE MOST SEVERE CONDITIONS IN A SALINE ENVIRONMENT WILL ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY. IF PHASE I IS SUCCESSFUL, PROTOTYPE CONNECTORS WILL BE FABRICATED FOR ANIMAL STUDIES, LEADING TOWARDS CLINICAL TRIALS DURING PHASE II.

THUS, A SELECTIVE NO REDUCTION TECHNIQUE IS NEEDED WHICH CONVERTS THE NO TO NITROGEN (N2) WITHOUT AFFECTING THE MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF O2 PRESENT. THE ONLY AVAILABLE REDUCING AGENT, HOWEVER, IS METHANE AND THERE HAS BEEN NO KNOWN METHOD BY WHICH METHANE COULD BE MADE TO REDUCE NO SELECTIVELY. A NEWLY DISCOVERED CHEMICAL REACTION IS DESCRIBED. IN THIS REACTION A PROPRIETARY SOLID UNDERGOES A RAPID REVERSIBLE REACTION WITH NO UNDER OXIDIZING CONDITIONS. THE POSITION OF THIS EQUILIBRIUM IS SENSITIVE TO THE CONCENTRATION OF O2 AND UNDER OXIDIZING CONDITIONS ESSENTIALLY QUANTITATIVE NO REMOVAL CAN BE ACHIEVED BY PASSING AN EXHAUST GAS CONTAINING NO THROUGH THE PROPRIETARY SOLID AT A HIGH SPACE VELOCITY.

THE DEVICE EMPLOYES A HOT-FILM ANEMOMETER TO SENSE TOTAL LOCAL AIRFLOW VELOCITY. THE TOTAL AIRFLOW VELOCITY IS THEN REDUCED TO TWOCOMPONENTS; THE TIME AVERAGE VELOCITY FIELD (U) AND THE ROOTMEAN SQUARE VELOCITY FLUCTUATIONS (URMS). THE RATIO OF THESE COMPONENTS (URMS/U) HAS A SIMPLE CORRESPONDENCE TO TURBULENCE INTESNITY WHICH, IN TURN, IS RELATED TO THE STALL OF AN AIRFOIL.

RECENT INTERESTHAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD THE USE OF HEAT PUMPS FOR REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN INCREASING PERFORMANCE AND LOWERING OPERATING COSTS. ONE HEAT PUMP SYSTEM THAT HAS SHOWN GREAT POTENTIAL IS BASED ON THE ABSORPTION AND DESORPTION OF HYDROGEN FROM METAL HYDRIDES. IN THIS SYSTEM, A LOW TEMPERATURE METAL HYDRIDE IS COUPLED TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE HYDRIDE, PERMITTING ENERGY TO BE EXTRACTED FROM THE SURROUNDINGS. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF THIS SYSTEM IS THAT THESE HEAT PUMPS OPERATE WITHOUT ANY MOVING PARTS, USING HYDROGEN AS THE WORKING FLUID IN A CLOSED CYCLE THAT CAN BE REPEATED INDEFINITELY. PERFORMANCE CAN BE INCREASED IN THESE THERMALLY DRIVEN HEAT PUMPS DURING TWO INSTANCES WHEN THE HEAT GENERATED DURING ABSORPTION OF HYDROGEN BY THE METAL HYDRIDE MUST BE REJECTED. IN BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES, THE REJECTION OF HEAT BY MEANS OF AN INNOVATIVE SCHEME WILL INCREASE THE RATE OF THE ABSORPTION PROCESS. IN ADDITION, THIS PROCESS CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT MUST BE SUPPLIED TO RAISE THE LOW TEMPERATURE HYDRIDE TO RE-START THE CYCLE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE HEAT PUMP'S OVER-ALL PERFORMANCE IS IMPROVED, MAKING IT MORE COMPETITIVE WITH STANDARD REFRIGERATOR AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS.

ONCE CONCEPT FOR DEVELOPING THIS DUCTILITY IS THE USE OF INNOVATIVE ROCK BOLTS AND SHOTCRETE LINERS. PATTERENED ROCK BOLTS AND SHOTCRETE ARE GENERALLY MORE ECONOMICAL THAN MONOLITHIC CONRETE WITH FRANGIBLE BACKPACKING, HOWEVER, TESTING HAS LIMITED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS TO THE 1/4 KBAR RANGE. THEREFORE, THE NEED EXISTS TO DEVELOP A ROCK BOLT - SHOTCRETE LINING SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES GREATER LEVELS OF HARDNESS BUT REMAINS MORE ECONOMICAL THAN THE CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE LINERS.

WHAT IS PROPOSED HERE IS AN INNOVATIVE METHOD OF RAPID MULTI-GAS ANALYSIS WHICH WILL LEAD TO A RUGGED AND COMPACT RESPIRATORY MONITOR. OUR TECHNIQUE IS BASED ON THE MEASUREMENT OF THE INTENSITY OF THE EMISSION OF SELECTED SPECTRAL LINES FROM A GLOW DISCHARGE. THE TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE TO DEVELOP A SUITABLE GLOW DISCHARGE TUBE AND TO BUILD AND TEST A PROTOTYPE GAS ANALYZER WITH THIS DISCHARGE TUBE AS ITS BASIC TRANSDUCER. THE DISCHARGE TUBE DESIGNS WILL INCLUDE VARIOUS GEOMETRIES AND CATHODE MATERIALS SELECTED TO MINIMIZE CATHODE SPUTTERING. THE TESTING OF THE COMPLETE PROTOTYPE ANALYZER WILL INCLUDE MEASUREMENT OF RANGE, LINEARITY, SIGNAL STRENGTH, NOISE, REPEATABILITY, AND RESPONSE TIME. IN PHASEII, THE ADDITION OF A FLOW MODULE AND DISPLAY MONITOR, ALONGWITH APPROPRIATE MINIATURIZATION, WILL LEAD TO A COMPLETE AND COMPACT RESPIRATORY MONITORING PACKAGE. IN ADDITION TO ITS USE IN THE SPACE STATION, THE POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS ANALYZER INCLUDE HOSPITAL BEDSIDE MONITORING, MOBILE STRESS AND EXERCISE TESTING, ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, AND PROCESS CONTROL.","agency":["National Aeronautics and Space Administration"],"program":"SBIR","phase":"Phase I","year":1989,"firm":"Northwest Research Associates, Inc.","reseach institution":null},{"title":"COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF THE CRITICALLY ILL","link":"https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/251492","abstract":"WITH THE IMPROVED MONITORING CAPABILITIES IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (ICU'S), THERE IS A GROWING NEED TO PROVIDE ENHANCED DATA-PROCESSING CAPABILITIES BOTH FOR BETTER PATIENT CARE AND MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF ICU PERSONNEL.
