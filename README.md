Entrepreneurs need support to start a business. As a first step, many are looking at America's seed fund (SBIR and STTR program). Each major federal agency dedicates about 3% of their budget to help entrepreneurs get started towards their new business through grant awards. As part of the application, a cost proposal must be submitted. Often, applicants struggle to come up with the right amount. My objective is build a model that can predict grant dollar amount so that
applicants can have a starting point of their budget.
