# Instagrant

Entrepreneurs need support to start a business. As a first step, many are looking at America's seed fund (SBIR and STTR program). Each major federal agency dedicates about 3% of their budget to help entrepreneurs get started towards their new business through grant awards. As part of the application, a cost proposal must be submitted. Often, applicants struggle to come up with the right amount. My objective is build a model that can predict grant dollar amount so that
applicants can have a starting point for their budget.

See this [presentation](https://github.com/cedricherman/Instagrant/blob/master/presentation/Cedric_Herman_Demo.pdf) for an overview of this project.

notebooks folder contains prototypes.
src folder hosts cleaned final version for production implementation.
sbir_app is a [flask application](http://entrepreneurgrants.science/) hosted on AWS that implements my model alongside css/html code.
